1	jolie's performance vanishes somewhere between her hair and her lips .
2	not far beneath the surface , this reconfigured tale asks disturbing questions about those things we expect from military epics .
3	i'm not exactly sure what this movie thinks it is about .
4	with an obvious rapport with her actors and a striking style behind the camera , hélène angel is definitely a director to watch .
5	clever but not especially compelling .
6	a compelling french psychological drama examining the encounter of an aloof father and his chilly son after 20 years apart .
7	it looks much more like a cartoon in the end than the simpsons ever has .
8	staggeringly dreadful romance .
9	solondz may well be the only one laughing at his own joke
10	though writer/director bart freundlich's film ultimately becomes a simplistic story about a dysfunctional parent-child relationship , it has some special qualities and the soulful gravity of crudup's anchoring performance .
11	i haven't seen such self-amused trash since freddy got fingered .
12	one of the most gloriously unsubtle and adrenalized extreme shockers since the evil dead .
13	the bland outweighs the nifty , and cletis tout never becomes the clever crime comedy it thinks it is .
14	the movie's plot is almost entirely witless and inane , carrying every gag two or three times beyond its limit to sustain a laugh .
15	paid in full is so stale , in fact , that its most vibrant scene is one that uses clips from brian de palma's scarface . that's a cheat .
16	i still can't relate to stuart : he's a mouse , for cryin' out loud , and all he does is milk it with despondent eyes and whine that nobody treats him human enough .
17	a muddled limp biscuit of a movie , a vampire soap opera that doesn't make much sense even on its own terms .
18	has enough wit , energy and geniality to please not only the fanatical adherents on either side , but also people who know nothing about the subject and think they're not interested .
19	the result is mesmerizing -- filled with menace and squalor .
20	fontaine masterfully creates a portrait of two strong men in conflict , inextricably entwined through family history , each seeing himself in the other , neither liking what he sees .
21	jaglom . . . put[s] the audience in the privileged position of eavesdropping on his characters
22	if the full monty was a freshman fluke , lucky break is [cattaneo] sophomore slump .
23	the action clichés just pile up .
24	a fine film , but it would be a lot better if it stuck to betty fisher and left out the other stories .
25	the movie has no respect for laws , political correctness or common decency , but it displays something more important : respect for its flawed , crazy people .
26	move over bond ; this girl deserves a sequel .
27	this slight premise . . . works because of the ideal casting of the masterful british actor ian holm as the aged napoleon .
28	this picture is mostly a lump of run-of-the-mill profanity sprinkled with a few remarks so geared toward engendering audience sympathy that you might think he was running for office -- or trying to win over a probation officer .
29	so many documentaries like this presuppose religious bigotry or zealous nuttiness of its antagonists , but family fundamentals displays a rare gift for unflinching impartiality .
30	has the disjointed feel of a bunch of strung-together tv episodes .
31	not one moment in the enterprise didn't make me want to lie down in a dark room with something cool to my brow .
32	the movie's eventual success should be credited to dennis quaid , in fighting trim shape as an athlete as well as an actor
33	it's mildly entertaining , especially if you find comfort in familiarity . but it's hardly a necessary enterprise .
34	if festival in cannes nails hard- boiled hollywood argot with a bracingly nasty accuracy , much about the film , including some of its casting , is frustratingly unconvincing .
35	the paradiso's rusted-out ruin and ultimate collapse during the film's final ( restored ) third…emotionally belittle a cinema classic . sometimes shorter is better .
36	this film's relationship to actual tension is the same as what christmas-tree flocking in a spray can is to actual snow : a poor -- if durable -- imitation .
37	the weakest of the four harry potter books has been transformed into the stronger of the two films by the thinnest of margins .
38	with elements cribbed from lang's metropolis , welles' kane , and eisenstein's potemkin , the true wonder of rintarô's metropolis is the number of lasting images all its own .
39	a film of quiet power .
40	what a great way to spend 4 units of your day .
41	filmmakers have to dig deep to sink this low . fortunately for all involved , this movie is likely to disappear as quickly as an ice cube thrown into a pot of boiling water .
42	watching trouble every day , at least if you don't know what's coming , is like biting into what looks like a juicy , delicious plum on a hot summer day and coming away with your mouth full of rotten pulp and living worms .
43	for 95 often hilarious minutes , [cho] riffs on the diciness of colonics , on straight versus gay personal ads , on how men would act if they had periods , and on the perils of a certain outré sexual practice .
44	an often-deadly boring , strange reading of a classic whose witty dialogue is treated with a baffling casual approach
45	in the end there is one word that best describes this film : honest .
46	makes a joke out of car chases for an hour and then gives us half an hour of car chases .
47	[chaiken's] talent lies in an evocative , accurate observation of a distinctive milieu and in the lively , convincing dialogue she creates for her characters .
48	one can't shake the feeling that crossroads is nothing more than an hour-and-a-half-long commercial for britney's latest album .
49	the real star of this movie is the score , as in the songs translate well to film , and it's really well directed .
50	birthday girl is an amusing joy ride , with some surprisingly violent moments .
51	os problemas têm início a partir do momento em que saímos do cinema e começamos a pensar sobre o que acabamos de ver . É então que sinais realmente desaponta .
52	neither as scary-funny as tremors nor demented-funny as starship troopers , the movie isn't tough to take as long as you've paid a matinee price .
53	world traveler might not go anywhere new , or arrive anyplace special , but it's certainly an honest attempt to get at something .
54	fierce , glaring and unforgettable .
55	it could change america , not only because it is full of necessary discussion points , but because it is so accessible that it makes complex politics understandable to viewers looking for nothing but energetic entertainment .
56	what emerges is an unsettling picture of childhood innocence combined with indoctrinated prejudice . promises is a compelling piece that demonstrates just how well children can be trained to live out and carry on their parents' anguish .
57	that rare film whose real-life basis is , in fact , so interesting that no embellishment is needed .
58	i'm sure if you're a hartley fan , you might enjoy yourself . . . me , i didn't care for it .
59	tadpole is emblematic of the witless ageism afflicting films : young is cool , and too young is too cool .
60	a decidedly mixed bag .
61	that neither protagonist has a distinguishable condition hardly matters because both are just actory concoctions , defined by childlike dimness and a handful of quirks .
62	i'd give real money to see the perpetrators of chicago torn apart by dingoes .
63	unflinchingly bleak and desperate
64	the crassness of this reactionary thriller is matched only by the ridiculousness of its premise .
65	the ending does leave you unfulfilled , but these are performances to enjoy in a memorable ensemble piece .
66	quietly engaging .
67	tuck everlasting achieves a delicate balance of romantic innocence and philosophical depth .
68	as plain and pedestrian as catsup--
69	it's frustrating to see these guys -- who are obviously pretty clever -- waste their talent on parodies of things they probably thought were funniest when they were high .
70	makes for a pretty unpleasant viewing experience .
71	a smart , provocative drama that does the nearly impossible : it gets under the skin of a man we only know as an evil , monstrous lunatic .
72	will no doubt delight plympton's legion of fans ; others may find 80 minutes of these shenanigans exhausting .
73	[taylor] takes us on a ride that's consistently surprising , easy to watch -- but , oh , so dumb .
74	quando tiros em columbine acerta o alvo ( com o perdão do trocadilho ) , não há como negar o brilhantismo da argumentação de seu diretor .
75	the movie's seams may show . . . but pellington gives " mothman " an irresistibly uncanny ambience that goes a long way toward keeping the picture compelling .
76	the acting is stiff , the story lacks all trace of wit , the sets look like they were borrowed from gilligan's island -- and the cgi scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year .
77	very amusing , not the usual route in a thriller , and the performances are odd and pixilated and sometimes both .
78	the performances are so leaden , michael rymer's direction is so bloodless and the dialogue is so corny that the audience laughs out loud .
79	austin powers in goldmember is a cinematic car wreck , a catastrophic collision of tastelessness and gall that nevertheless will leave fans clamoring for another ride .
80	an invaluable historical document thanks to the filmmaker's extraordinary access to massoud , whose charm , cultivation and devotion to his people are readily apparent .
81	harsh , effective documentary on life in the israeli-occupied palestinian territories .
82	an exhausting family drama about a porcelain empire and just as hard a flick as its subject matter .
83	ranks among willams' best screen work .
84	the art direction is often exquisite , and the anthropomorphic animal characters are beautifully realized through clever makeup design , leaving one to hope that the eventual dvd release will offer subtitles and the original italian-language soundtrack .
85	though there's a clarity of purpose and even-handedness to the film's direction , the drama feels rigged and sluggish .
86	and if you appreciate the one-sided theme to lawrence's over-indulgent tirade , then knock yourself out and enjoy the big screen postcard that is a self-glorified martin lawrence lovefest . if you are willing to do this , then you so crazy !
87	it's difficult to conceive of anyone who has reached puberty actually finding the characters in slackers or their antics amusing , let alone funny .
88	a marvelous performance by allison lohman as an identity-seeking foster child .
89	with virtually no interesting elements for an audience to focus on , chelsea walls is a triple-espresso endurance challenge .
90	taken as a whole , the tuxedo doesn't add up to a whole lot .
91	yes , i have given this movie a rating of zero . but fans of the show should not consider this a diss . consider it 'perfection . '
92	one of the most original american productions this year , you'll find yourself remembering this refreshing visit to a sunshine state .
93	the film's constant mood of melancholy and its unhurried narrative are masterfully controlled . but … in trying to capture the novel's deeper intimate resonances , the film has – ironically - distanced us from the characters .
94	assayas' ambitious , sometimes beautiful adaptation of jacques chardonne's novel .
95	tsai convincingly paints a specifically urban sense of disassociation here .
96	only two-fifths of a satisfying movie experience .
97	eight crazy nights is a showcase for sandler's many talents .
98	director uwe boll and the actors provide scant reason to care in this crude '70s throwback .
99	caso você sinta necessidade de sair da sala antes do término da projeção , não se preocupe : ninguém lhe enviará penas simbolizando covardia .
100	movies like high crimes flog the dead horse of surprise as if it were an obligation . how about surprising us by trying something new ?
101	it's incredible the number of stories the holocaust has generated . just when you think that every possible angle has been exhausted by documentarians , another new film emerges with yet another remarkable yet shockingly little-known perspective .
102	the movie is virtually without context -- journalistic or historical . what's worse is that pelosi knows it .
103	full of detail about the man and his country , and is well worth seeing .
104	a lovably old-school hollywood confection .
105	the pacing is glacial , the screenplay is stiff as a board , and things heat up only in the movie's final scenes .
106	may not have generated many sparks , but with his affection for astoria and its people he has given his tale a warm glow .
107	the movie isn't just hilarious : it's witty and inventive , too , and in hindsight , it isn't even all that dumb .
108	has a lot of the virtues of eastwood at his best .
109	as simple and innocent a movie as you can imagine . this is a movie you can trust .
110	never lets go your emotions , taking them to surprising highs , sorrowful lows and hidden impulsive niches . . . gorgeous , passionate , and at times uncommonly moving .
111	watching it is rather like an overlong visit from a large group of your relatives . as your relatives swap one mundane story after another , you begin to wonder if they are ever going to depart .
112	the film fearlessly gets under the skin of the people involved . . . this makes it not only a detailed historical document , but an engaging and moving portrait of a subculture .
113	earns its laughs from stock redneck 'types' and from the many , many moments when we recognize even without the elizabethan prose , the play behind the thing .
114	for a film about two mismatched buddies , crystal and de niro share little screen time and even less chemistry .
115	the reason to see " sade " lay with the chemistry and complex relationship between the marquis ( auteil ) and emilie ( le besco ) .
116	the fly-on-the-wall method used to document rural french school life is a refreshing departure from the now more prevalent technique of the docu-makers being a visible part of their work .
117	effective but too-tepid biopic
118	soderbergh skims the fat from the 1972 film . what's left is a rich stew of longing .
119	disappointingly , the characters are too strange and dysfunctional , tom included , to ever get under the skin , but this is compensated in large part by the off-the-wall dialogue , visual playfulness and the outlandishness of the idea itself .
120	watching e . t now , in an era dominated by cold , loud special-effects-laden extravaganzas , one is struck less by its lavish grandeur than by its intimacy and precision .
121	clockstoppers is one of those crazy , mixed-up films that doesn't know what it wants to be when it grows up .
122	waydowntown may not be an important movie , or even a good one , but it provides a nice change of mindless pace in collision with the hot oscar season currently underway .
123	an operatic , sprawling picture that's entertainingly acted , magnificently shot and gripping enough to sustain most of its 170-minute length .
124	for decades we've marveled at disney's rendering of water , snow , flames and shadows in a hand-drawn animated world . prepare to marvel again .
125	el crimen del padre amaro would likely be most effective if used as a tool to rally anti-catholic protestors .
126	it isn't that stealing harvard is a horrible movie—if only it were that grand a failure ! it's just that it's so not-at-all-good . and i expect much more from a talent as outstanding as director bruce mcculloch .
127	offers much to enjoy . . . and a lot to mull over in terms of love , loyalty and the nature of staying friends .
128	a taut , sobering film .
129	apart from its own considerable achievement , metropolis confirms tezuka's status as both the primary visual influence on the animé tradition and its defining philosophical conscience .
130	the wonderful combination of the sweetness and the extraordinary technical accomplishments of the first film are maintained , but its overall impact falls a little flat with a storyline that never quite delivers the original magic .
131	pretend it's a werewolf itself by avoiding eye contact and walking slowly away . it's fun , but it's a real howler .
132	despite its flaws , crazy as hell marks an encouraging new direction for la salle .
133	a film that will be best appreciated by those willing to endure its extremely languorous rhythms , waiting for happiness is ultimately thoughtful without having much dramatic impact .
134	not that any of us should be complaining when a film clocks in around 90 minutes these days , but the plotting here leaves a lot to be desired .
135	it offers a glimpse of the solomonic decision facing jewish parents in those turbulent times : to save their children and yet to lose them .
136	it's pretty linear and only makeup-deep , but bogdanovich ties it together with efficiency and an affection for the period .
137	this is a shrewd and effective film from a director who understands how to create and sustain a mood .
138	the kind of movie that comes along only occasionally , one so unconventional , gutsy and perfectly executed it takes your breath away .
139	highly irritating at first , mr . koury's passive technique eventually begins to yield some interesting results .
140	the master of disguise is funny--not " ha ha " funny , " dead circus performer " funny . and for all the wrong reasons besides .
141	if oscar had a category called best bad film you thought was going to be really awful but wasn't , guys would probably be duking it out with the queen of the damned for the honor .
142	an afterschool special without the courage of its convictions .
143	the movie is a negligible work of manipulation , an exploitation piece doing its usual worst to guilt-trip parents .
144	an excellent romp that boasts both a heart and a mind .
145	a film that clearly means to preach exclusively to the converted .
146	this is a finely written , superbly acted offbeat thriller .
147	in a normal screen process , these bromides would be barely enough to sustain an interstitial program on the discovery channel . but in imax 3-d , the clichés disappear into the vertiginous perspectives opened up by the photography .
148	an hour and a half of joyful solo performance .
149	there are deeply religious and spiritual people in this world who would argue that entering a church , synagogue or temple doesn't mean you have to check your brain at the door . the same should go for movie theaters .
150	lejos del paraíso es al mismo tiempo una fiesta para los ojos y oídos y un movilizador cuadro de personajes enfrentados a sus propios deseos , miedos y prejuicios .
151	a hit- and-miss affair , consistently amusing but not as outrageous or funny as cho may have intended or as imaginative as one might have hoped .
152	a twisty , moody slice of southern gothic . . .
153	a tone poem of transgression .
154	when one hears harry shearer is going to make his debut as a film director , one would hope for the best
155	while there's likely very little crossover appeal to those without much interest in the elizabethans ( as well as rank frustration from those in the know about rubbo's dumbed-down tactics ) , much ado about something is an amicable endeavor .
156	an adorably whimsical comedy that deserves more than a passing twinkle .
157	'unfaithful' cheats on itself and retreats to comfortable territory . too bad .
158	sound the trumpets : for the first time since desperately seeking susan , madonna doesn't suck as an actress .
159	terrible .
160	moonlight mile gives itself the freedom to feel contradictory things . it is sentimental but feels free to offend , is analytical and then surrenders to the illogic of its characters , is about grief and yet permits laughter .
161	the cartoon that isn't really good enough to be on afternoon tv is now a movie that isn't really good enough to be in theaters .
162	strangely comes off as a kingdom more mild than wild .
163	i've always dreamed of attending cannes , but after seeing this film , it's not that big a deal .
164	overall , it's a wacky and inspired little film that works effortlessly at delivering genuine , acerbic laughs .
165	soul is what's lacking in every character in this movie and , subsequently , the movie itself .
166	es triste tener que decirles que lo único grato de la cinta es el cuerpo desnudo de la heather . . .
167	'pocas veces es posible ver un elenco tan compenetrado con la historia , donde todos y cada uno de los actores ofrecen actuaciones verdaderamente memorables . '
168	while howard's appreciation of brown and his writing is clearly well-meaning and sincere , the movie would be impossible to sit through were it not for the supporting cast .
169	the young stars are too cute ; the story and ensuing complications are too manipulative ; the message is too blatant ; the resolutions are too convenient .
170	the idea of 49-year-old roberto benigni playing the wooden boy pinocchio is scary enough . the reality of the new live-action pinocchio he directed , cowrote and starred in borders on the grotesque .
171	takes a fresh and absorbing look at a figure whose legacy had begun to bronze .
172	resident evil isn't a product of its cinematic predecessors so much as an mtv , sugar hysteria , and playstation cocktail .
173	while guzmán frustratingly refuses to give pinochet's crimes a political context , his distance from the material is mostly admirable .
174	almost as offensive as " freddy got fingered . "
175	beautiful , angry and sad , with a curious sick poetry , as if the marquis de sade had gone in for pastel landscapes .
176	on its own , it's not very interesting . as a remake , it's a pale imitation .
177	even after 90 minutes of playing opposite each other bullock and grant still look ill at ease sharing the same scene . what should have been a painless time-killer becomes instead a grating endurance test .
178	a silly , self-indulgent film about a silly , self-indulgent filmmaker .
179	this movie has a strong message about never giving up on a loved one , but it's not an easy movie to watch and will probably disturb many who see it .
180	isabelle huppert excels as the enigmatic mika and anna mouglalis is a stunning new young talent in one of chabrol's most intense psychological mysteries .
181	as gory as the scenes of torture and self-mutilation may be , they are pitted against shimmering cinematography that lends the setting the ethereal beauty of an asian landscape painting .
182	it's probably not easy to make such a worthless film . . .
183	a fine effort , an interesting topic , some intriguing characters and a sad ending . certainly the big finish wasn't something galinsky and hawley could have planned for . . . but part of being a good documentarian is being there when the rope snaps .
184	the ring just left me cold and wet like i was out in the seattle drizzle without rainwear .
185	between bedroom scenes , viewers may find themselves wishing they could roll over and take a nap .
186	the movie is hardly a masterpiece , but it does mark ms . bullock's best work in some time .
187	a close-to-solid espionage thriller with the misfortune of being released a few decades too late .
188	the adventure doesn't contain half the excitement of balto , or quarter the fun of toy story 2 .
189	what you get with empire is a movie you've seen many times before , repackaged as new material because there is a latino in the lead .
190	don't be fooled by the impressive cast list - eye see you is pure junk .
191	an amused indictment of jaglom's own profession .
192	however stale the material , lawrence's delivery remains perfect ; his great gift is that he can actually trick you into thinking some of this worn-out , pandering palaver is actually funny .
193	an effective portrait of a life in stasis -- of the power of inertia to arrest development in a dead-end existence .
194	a whimsical if predictable time-travel fable marred by a willful single-mindedness .
195	occasionally funny , always very colorful and enjoyably overblown in the traditional almodóvar style .
196	there is no pleasure in watching a child suffer . just embarrassment and a vague sense of shame .
197	it is great summer fun to watch arnold and his buddy gerald bounce off a quirky cast of characters .
198	here polanski looks back on those places he saw at childhood , and captures them by freeing them from artefact , and by showing them heartbreakingly drably .
199	the success of undercover brother is found in its ability to spoof both black and white stereotypes equally .
200	the best film of the year 2002 .
201	it's an unusual , thoughtful bio-drama with a rich subject and some fantastic moments and scenes .
202	aspires for the piquant but only really achieves a sort of ridiculous sourness .
203	the band performances featured in drumline are red hot . . . [but] from a mere story point of view , the film's ice cold .
204	irwin and his director never come up with an adequate reason why we should pay money for what we can get on television for free .
205	might be one of those vanity projects in which a renowned filmmaker attempts to show off his talent by surrounding himself with untalented people .
206	such master screenwriting comes courtesy of john pogue , the yale grad who previously gave us " the skulls " and last year's " rollerball . " enough said , except : film overboard !
207	presents a good case while failing to provide a reason for us to care beyond the very basic dictums of human decency .
208	nair and writer laura cahill dare to build a movie around some flawed but rather unexceptional women , emerging with a fine character study that's short on plot but rich in the tiny revelations of real life .
209	stitch is a bad mannered , ugly and destructive little * * * * . no cute factor here… . not that i mind ugly ; the problem is he has no character , loveable or otherwise .
210	in the end , all you can do is admire the ensemble players and wonder what the point of it is .
211	the first fatal attraction was vile enough . do we really need the tiger beat version ?
212	" men in black ii , " has all the earmarks of a sequel . the story is less vibrant , the jokes are a little lukewarm , but will anyone really care ?
213	stupid , infantile , redundant , sloppy , over-the-top , and amateurish . yep , it's " waking up in reno . " go back to sleep .
214	[h]ad i suffered and bled on the hard ground of ia drang , i'd want something a bit more complex than we were soldiers to be remembered by .
215	defies logic , the laws of physics and almost anyone's willingness to believe in it . but darned if it doesn't also keep us riveted to our seats .
216	each punch seen through prison bars , the fights become not so much a struggle of man vs . man as brother-man vs . the man .
217	like schindler's list , the grey zone attempts to be grandiloquent , but ends up merely pretentious -- in a grisly sort of way .
218	an off-beat and fanciful film about the human need for monsters to blame for all that is amiss in the world .
219	an absorbing trip into the minds and motivations of people under stress as well as a keen , unsentimental look at variations on the theme of motherhood .
220	is it possible for a documentary to be utterly entranced by its subject and still show virtually no understanding of it ?
221	peppered with witty dialogue and inventive moments .
222	reeks of rot and hack work from start to finish .
223	i doubt anyone will remember the picture by the time christmas really rolls around , but maybe it'll be on video by then .
224	haneke keeps us at arm's length . guided more by intellect than heart , his story flattens instead of sharpens .
225	one of those rare films that come by once in a while with flawless amounts of acting , direction , story and pace .
226	[grant] goes beyond his usual fluttering and stammering and captures the soul of a man in pain who gradually comes to recognize it and deal with it .
227	lush and beautifully photographed ( somebody suggested the stills might make a nice coffee table book ) , but ultimately you'll leave the theater wondering why these people mattered .
228	the year's greatest adventure , and jackson's limited but enthusiastic adaptation has made literature literal without killing its soul -- a feat any thinking person is bound to appreciate .
229	frida's artistic brilliance is undeniable -- it's among the most breathtakingly designed films i've ever seen .
230	even in this less-than-magic kingdom , reese rules .
231	marinated in clichés and mawkish dialogue .
232	this 90-minute postmodern voyage was more diverting and thought-provoking than i'd expected it to be .
233	[soderbergh] tends to place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience's intelligence , and he creates an overall sense of brusqueness .
234	i could just feel the screenwriter at every moment 'tap , tap , tap , tap , tapping away' on this screenplay .
235	an intelligent , moving and invigorating film .
236	boll uses a lot of quick cutting and blurry step-printing to goose things up , but dopey dialogue and sometimes inadequate performances kill the effect .
237	no cliche escapes the perfervid treatment of gang warfare called ces wild .
238	i don't think i laughed out loud once . and when you're talking about a slapstick comedy , that's a pretty big problem .
239	first-time director joão pedro rodrigues' unwillingness to define his hero's background or motivations becomes more and more frustrating as the film goes on .
240	it's usually a bad sign when directors abandon their scripts and go where the moment takes them , but olympia , wash . , based filmmakers anne de marcken and marilyn freeman did just that and it's what makes their project so interesting .
241	bon appétit ! just like a splendid meal , red dragon satisfies – from its ripe recipe , inspiring ingredients , certified cuisine and palatable presentation .
242	seeks to transcend its genre with a curiously stylized , quasi-shakespearean portrait of pure misogynist evil .
243	this delicately observed story , deeply felt and masterfully stylized , is a triumph for its maverick director .
244	britney spears' phoniness is nothing compared to the movie's contrived , lame screenplay and listless direction .
245	it's better than the phantom menace . but unless you're an absolute raving star wars junkie , it isn't much fun .
246	weiss and speck never make a convincing case for the relevance of these two 20th-century footnotes .
247	it proves quite compelling as an intense , brooding character study .
248	maelstrom is strange and compelling , engrossing and different , a moral tale with a twisted sense of humor .
249	. . . plays like somebody spliced random moments of a chris rock routine into what is otherwise a cliche-riddled but self-serious spy thriller .
250	the movie is amateurish , but it's a minor treat .
251	if you've ever entertained the notion of doing what the title of this film implies , what sex with strangers actually shows may put you off the idea forever .
252	such a wildly uneven hit-and-miss enterprise , you can't help suspecting that it was improvised on a day-to-day basis during production .
253	like mike is a harmlessly naïve slice of b-ball fantasy , fit for filling in during the real nba's off-season .
254	. . . understands that a generation defines its music as much as the music defines a generation .
255	brilliantly written and well-acted , yellow asphalt is an uncompromising film .

258	standing in the shadows of motown is the best kind of documentary , one that makes a depleted yesterday feel very much like a brand-new tomorrow .
259	all the more disquieting for its relatively gore-free allusions to the serial murders , but it falls down in its attempts to humanize its subject .
260	the feature-length stretch . . . strains the show's concept .
261	there's something deeply creepy about never again , a new arrow in schaeffer's quiver of ineptitudes .
262	very well-written and very well-acted .
263	o fantasma is boldly , confidently orchestrated , aesthetically and sexually , and its impact is deeply and rightly disturbing .
264	nair stuffs the film with dancing , henna , ornamentation , and group song , but her narrative clichés and telegraphed episodes smell of old soap opera .
265	adam sandler's 8 crazy nights is 75 wasted minutes of sandler as the voice-over hero in columbia pictures' perverse idea of an animated holiday movie .
266	god help the poor woman if attal is this insecure in real life : his fictional yvan's neuroses are aggravating enough to exhaust the patience of even the most understanding spouse .
267	it's up to [watts] to lend credibility to this strange scenario , and her presence succeeds in making us believe .
268	lillard and cardellini earn their scooby snacks , but not anyone else .
269	as a kind of colorful , dramatized pbs program , frida gets the job done . but , for that , why not watch a documentary ?
270	tambor and clayburgh make an appealing couple — he's understated and sardonic , she's appealingly manic and energetic . both deserve better .
271	frustratingly , dridi tells us nothing about el gallo other than what emerges through his music .
272	it's fun , splashy and entertainingly nasty .
273	while [roman coppola] scores points for style , he staggers in terms of story .
274	there's very little sense to what's going on here , but the makers serve up the cliches with considerable dash .
275	none of the characters or plot-lines are fleshed-out enough to build any interest .
276	more likely to have you scratching your head than hiding under your seat .
277	that storytelling has value cannot be denied . not even solondz's thirst for controversy , sketchy characters and immature provocations can fully succeed at cheapening it .
278	distances you by throwing out so many red herrings , so many false scares , that the genuine ones barely register .
279	the film's heady yet far from impenetrable theory suggests that russians take comfort in their closed-off nationalist reality .
280	the film is surprisingly well-directed by brett ratner , who keeps things moving well -- at least until the problematic third act .
281	uncertain in tone . . . a garbled exercise in sexual politics , a junior varsity short cuts by way of very bad things .
282	the film has a kind of hard , cold effect .
283	makes 98 minutes feel like three hours .
284	a real winner -- smart , funny , subtle , and resonant .
285	drawing on an irresistible , languid romanticism , byler reveals the ways in which a sultry evening or a beer-fueled afternoon in the sun can inspire even the most retiring heart to venture forth .
286	a refreshing change from the usual whoopee-cushion effort aimed at the youth market .
287	more romantic , more emotional and ultimately more satisfying than the teary-eyed original .
288	a coming-of-age film that avoids the cartoonish clichés and sneering humor of the genre as it provides a fresh view of an old type -- the uncertain girl on the brink of womanhood .
289	[there's] quite a bit of heart , as you would expect from the directors of the little mermaid and aladdin .
290	miller tells this very compelling tale with little fuss or noise , expertly plucking tension from quiet .
291	while this film is not in the least surprising , it is still ultimately very satisfying . think of it as a sort of comfort food for the mind .
292	as shaky as the plot is , kaufman's script is still memorable for some great one-liners .

294	tv skit-com material fervently deposited on the big screen .
295	[ " safe conduct " ] is a long movie at 163 minutes but it fills the time with drama , romance , tragedy , bravery , political intrigue , partisans and sabotage . viva le resistance !
296	city by the sea is a gritty police thriller with all the dysfunctional family dynamics one could wish for . but how it washed out despite all of that is the project's prime mystery .
297	maneuvers skillfully through the plot's hot brine -- until it's undone by the sogginess of its contemporary characters , and actors .
298	there is not a character in the movie with a shred of plausibility , not an event that is believable , not a confrontation that is not staged , not a moment that is not false .
299	labute was more fun when his characters were torturing each other psychologically and talking about their genitals in public .
300	. . . routine , harmless diversion and little else .
301	lathan and diggs have considerable personal charm , and their screen rapport makes the old story seem new .
302	nine queens is not only than a frighteningly capable debut and genre piece , but also a snapshot of a dangerous political situation on the verge of coming to a head .
303	simply put , there should have been a more compelling excuse to pair susan sarandon and goldie hawn .
304	jagger , stoppard and director michael apted . . . deliver a riveting and surprisingly romantic ride .
305	where this was lazy but enjoyable , a formula comedy redeemed by its stars , that is even lazier and far less enjoyable .
306	with tiny little jokes and nary an original idea , this sappy ethnic sleeper proves that not only blockbusters pollute the summer movie pool .
307	it appears to have been modeled on the worst revenge-of-the-nerds clichés the filmmakers could dredge up .
308	this is a movie that starts out like heathers , then becomes bring it on , then becomes unwatchable .
309	a brutal and funny work . nicole holofcenter , the insightful writer/director responsible for this illuminating comedy doesn't wrap the proceedings up neatly but the ideas tie together beautifully .
310	a frustrating combination of strained humor and heavy-handed sentimentality .
311	toes the fine line between cheese and earnestness remarkably well ; everything is delivered with such conviction that it's hard not to be carried away .
312	by presenting an impossible romance in an impossible world , pumpkin dares us to say why either is impossible -- which forces us to confront what's possible and what we might do to make it so .
313	the french are rather good at this kind of thing , unlike the americans , who have a passion for musketeers , only to spoof them .
314	audiences will find no mention of political prisoners or persecutions that might paint the castro regime in less than saintly tones .
315	[gayton's script] telegraphs every discovery and layers on the gloss of convenience .

317	the title not only describes its main characters , but the lazy people behind the camera as well .
318	noyce films it more as a shocking history lesson than as drama .
319	muccino , who directed from his own screenplay , is a canny crowd pleaser , and the last kiss . . . provides more than enough sentimental catharsis for a satisfying evening at the multiplex .
320	its solemn pretension prevents us from sharing the awe in which it holds itself .
321	one gets the impression the creators of don't ask don't tell laughed a hell of a lot at their own jokes . too bad none of it is funny .
322	why sit through a crummy , wannabe-hip crime comedy that refers incessantly to old movies , when you could just rent those movies instead , let alone seek out a respectable new one ?

324	its generic villains lack any intrigue ( other than their funny accents ) and the action scenes are poorly delivered .
325	it won't hold up over the long haul , but in the moment , finch's tale provides the forgettable pleasures of a saturday matinee .
326	i didn't laugh at the ongoing efforts of cube , and his skinny buddy mike epps , to make like laurel and hardy 'n the hood .
327	an enjoyable comedy of lingual and cultural differences… the château is a film -- full of life and small delights -- that has all the wiggling energy of young kitten .
328	delightfully rendered
329	satin rouge is not a new , or inventive , journey , but it's encouraging to see a three-dimensional , average , middle-aged woman's experience of self-discovery handled with such sensitivity .
330	in painting an unabashedly romantic picture of a nation whose songs spring directly from the lives of the people , the movie exalts the marxian dream of honest working folk , with little to show for their labor , living harmoniously , joined in song .
331	despite the 2-d animation , the wild thornberrys movie makes for a surprisingly cinematic experience .
332	been there , done that , liked it much better the first time around - when it was called the professional .
333	as [the characters] get more depressed , the story gets more tiresome , especially as it continues to mount a conspicuous effort to be profound .
334	ong's promising debut is a warm and well-told tale of one recent chinese immigrant's experiences in new york city .
335	often silly – and gross – but it's rarely as moronic as some campus gross-out films .
336	one of the worst films of 2002 .
337	beautifully directed and convincingly acted .
338	the milieu is wholly unconvincing . . . and the histrionics reach a truly annoying pitch .
339	i wish windtalkers had had more faith in the dramatic potential of this true story . this would have been better than the fiction it has concocted , and there still could have been room for the war scenes .
340	twist open the ouzo ! it's time to let your hair down – greek style . a vibrant whirlwind of love , family and all that goes with it , my big fat greek wedding is a non-stop funny feast of warmth , colour and cringe .
341	it's a stunning lyrical work of considerable force and truth .
342	just how extreme are these ops ? i regret to report that these ops are just not extreme enough .
343	a sophomoric exploration of 'life problems' most people solved long ago -- or at least got tired of hearing people kvetch about .
344	campbell scott finds the ideal outlet for his flick-knife diction in the role of roger swanson .
345	the bottom line with nemesis is the same as it has been with all the films in the series : fans will undoubtedly enjoy it , and the uncommitted needn't waste their time on it .
346	a feeble tootsie knockoff .
347	throw smoochy from the train !
348	fontaine's direction , especially her agreeably startling use of close-ups and her grace with a moving camera , creates sheerly cinematic appeal .
349	the doofus-on- the-loose banter of welcome to collinwood has a cocky , after-hours loopiness to it . and as with most late-night bull sessions , eventually the content isn't nearly as captivating as the rowdy participants think it is .
350	. . . a preachy parable stylized with a touch of john woo bullet ballet .
351	though there are entertaining and audacious moments , the movie's wildly careening tone and an extremely flat lead performance do little to salvage this filmmaker's flailing reputation .
352	where the film falters is in its tone .
353	like an episode of mtv's undressed , with 20 times the creativity but without any more substance . . . indulgently entertaining but could have and should have been deeper .
354	despite its lavish formalism and intellectual austerity , the film manages to keep you at the edge of your seat with its shape-shifting perils , political intrigue and brushes with calamity .
355	a strong script , powerful direction and splendid production design allows us to be transported into the life of wladyslaw szpilman , who is not only a pianist , but a good human being .
356	más sarcástica , divertida y demencial que su predecesora , es un buen ejemplo de lo que es el cine de entretenimiento puro y sin complejos .
357	" punch-drunk love " is a little like a chocolate milk moustache . . .
358	it's as raw and action-packed an experience as a ringside seat at a tough-man contest .
359	a pleasing , often-funny comedy .
360	real women have curves wears its empowerment on its sleeve but even its worst harangues are easy to swallow thanks to remarkable performances by ferrera and ontiveros .
361	no new plot conceptions or environmental changes , just different bodies for sharp objects to rip through .
362	exciting documentary .
363	no dia em que aceitou dirigir esta continuação , harold ramis deve ter saído da cama com o pé esquerdo . e aqueles que decidiram assistir a este filme também .
364	dialogue-heavy and too cerebral for its own good -- or , at any rate , too cerebral for its racy subject matter .
365	a stunning and overwhelmingly cogent case for kissinger as a calculating war criminal .
366	it's as if solondz had two ideas for two movies , couldn't really figure out how to flesh either out , so he just slopped ‘em together here .
367	it takes talent to make a lifeless movie about the most heinous man who ever lived .
368	the film takes too long getting to the good stuff , then takes too long figuring out what to do next .
369	the film didn't convince me that calvin jr . 's barbershop represents some sort of beacon of hope in the middle of chicago's south side .
370	roman coppola may never become the filmmaker his dad was , but heck – few filmmakers will . but based on cq , i'll certainly be keeping an eye out for his next project .
371	an appealingly juvenile trifle that delivers its share of laughs and smiles .
372	the last 20 minutes are somewhat redeeming , but most of the movie is the same teenage american road-trip drek we've seen before - only this time you have to read the fart jokes
373	its premise is smart , but the execution is pretty weary .
374	. . . [the film] works , due mostly to the tongue-in-cheek attitude of the screenplay .
375	a big , gorgeous , sprawling swashbuckler that delivers its diversions in grand , uncomplicated fashion .
376	with jump cuts , fast editing and lots of pyrotechnics , yu clearly hopes to camouflage how bad his movie is . he fails .
377	if you saw benigni's pinocchio at a public park , you'd grab your kids and run and then probably call the police .
378	a series of escapades demonstrating the adage that what is good for the goose is also good for the gander , some of which occasionally amuses but none of which amounts to much of a story .
379	there's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there's nothing else happening .
380	adolescents will be adequately served by the movie's sophomoric blend of shenanigans and slapstick , although the more lascivious-minded might be disappointed in the relative modesty of a movie that sports a 'topless tutorial service . '
381	" collateral damage " goes by the numbers and reps decent action entertainment – until the silly showdown ending that forces the viewer to totally suspend disbelief
382	because the genre is well established , what makes the movie fresh is smart writing , skewed characters , and the title performance by kieran culkin .
383	a pure participatory event that malnourished intellectuals will gulp down in a frenzy .
384	a dark comedy that goes for sick and demented humor simply to do so . the movie is without intent .
385	gran historia sobre el amor , la familia , la lealtad y la traición que seguramente se convertirá en un nuevo clásico del género .
386	it ultimately stands forth as an important chronicle of the abuses of one of latin america's most oppressive regimes .
387	a wild , endearing , masterful documentary .
388	with recent tensions rekindled by the kathleen soliah trial and the upcoming trial of sla members emily and william harris , not to mention sept . 11 , its difficult these days to appreciate fire's bright side .
389	in this film , aussie david caesar channels the not-quite-dead career of guy ritchie .
390	in its treatment of the dehumanizing and ego-destroying process of unemployment , time out offers an exploration that is more accurate than anything i have seen in an american film .
391	highly watchable stuff .
392	like a can of 2-day old coke . you can taste it , but there's no fizz .
393	a coming-of-age movie that hollywood wouldn't have the guts to make .
394	a few pieces of the film buzz and whir ; very little of it actually clicks . the thing just never gets off the ground .
395	performances are potent , and the women's stories are ably intercut and involving .
396	her film is like a beautiful food entrée that isn't heated properly , so that it ends up a bit cold and relatively flavorless .
397	star trek : nemesis meekly goes where nearly every star trek movie has gone before . wince-inducing dialogue , thrift-shop costumes , prosthetic makeup by silly putty and kmart blue-light-special effects all conspire to test trekkie loyalty .
398	nair's attention to detail creates an impeccable sense of place , while thurman and lewis give what can easily be considered career-best performances .
399	what bubbles up out of john c . walsh's pipe dream is the distinct and very welcome sense of watching intelligent people making a movie they might actually want to watch .
400	this is unusual , food-for-thought cinema that's as entertaining as it is instructive .
401	after collateral damage , you might imagine that most every aggrieved father cliché has been unturned . but no .
402	so fiendishly cunning that even the most jaded cinema audiences will leave the auditorium feeling dizzy , confused , and totally disorientated . not to mention absolutely refreshed .
403	hey arnold ! the movie is what happens when you blow up small potatoes to 10 times their natural size , and it ain't pretty .
404	a beautiful paean to a time long past .
405	plays like a bad blend of an overripe episode of tv's dawson's creek and a recycled and dumbed-down version of love story .
406	the film is so packed with subplots involving the various silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a tv series than a feature film .
407	the whole film has this sneaky feel to it – as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as very important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a hollywood product .
408	a brisk , reverent , and subtly different sequel .
409	the film thrusts the inchoate but already eldritch christian right propaganda machine into national media circles .
410	both an admirable reconstruction of terrible events , and a fitting memorial to the dead of that day , and of the thousands thereafter .
411	williams creates a stunning , taxi driver-esque portrayal of a man teetering on the edge of sanity .
412	a gem , captured in the unhurried , low-key style favored by many directors of the iranian new wave .
413	combines sharp comedy , old-fashioned monster movie atmospherics , and genuine heart to create a film that's not merely about kicking undead * * * , but also about dealing with regret and , ultimately , finding redemption .
414	thirteen conversations about one thing lays out a narrative puzzle that interweaves individual stories , and , like a mobius strip , elliptically loops back to where it began .
415	beneath the film's obvious determination to shock at any cost lies considerable skill and determination , backed by sheer nerve .
416	all analyze that proves is that there is really only one movie's worth of decent gags to be gleaned from the premise .
417	a hypnotic cyber hymn and a cruel story of youth culture .
418	giggling at the absurdities and inconsistencies is part of the fun . but the talented cast alone will keep you watching , as will the fight scenes .
419	the most brilliant and brutal uk crime film since jack carter went back to newcastle , the first half of gangster no . 1 drips with style and , at times , blood .
420	it's fun , but a psychological mess , with austin powers bumping his head on the way out of the closet .
421	using his audience as a figurative port-of-call , dong pulls his even-handed ideological ship to their dock for unloading , before he continues his longer journey still ahead .
422	a faster paced family flick . upper teens may get cynical . smaller numbered kidlets will enjoy .
423	the comedy is nonexistent .
424	outrageousness is all plympton seemed to be going for this time . we miss the quirky amazement that used to come along for an integral part of the ride .
425	a frankenstein mishmash that careens from dark satire to cartoonish slapstick , bartleby performs neither one very well .
426	a story about intelligent high school students that deals with first love sweetly but also seriously . it is also beautifully acted .
427	manages to delight without much of a story .
428	no matter how firmly director john stainton has his tongue in his cheek , the fact remains that a wacky concept does not a movie make .
429	candid camera on methamphetamines .
430	a savvy exploration of paranoia and insecurity in america's culture of fear .
431	. . . somehow manages to escape the shackles of its own clichés to be the best espionage picture to come out in weeks .
432	a compelling yarn , but not quite a ripping one .
433	poetry in motion captured on film . while it can be a bit repetitive , overall it's an entertaining and informative documentary .
434	this is sandler running on empty , repeating what he's already done way too often .
435	here the love scenes all end in someone screaming . maybe there's a metaphor here , but figuring it out wouldn't make trouble every day any better .
436	the threat implied in the title pokémon 4ever is terrifying – like locusts in a horde these things will keep coming .
437	it's an earnest debut full of heartfelt performances , but is ultimately let down by a story that is all too predictable .
438	richard gere and diane lane put in fine performances as does french actor oliver martinez .
439	a superlative b movie -- funny , sexy , and rousing .
440	the woodman seems to have directly influenced this girl-meets-girl love story , but even more reassuring is how its makers actually seem to understand what made allen's romantic comedies so pertinent and enduring .
441	without resorting to hyperbole , i can state that kissing jessica stein may be the best same-sex romance i have seen .
442	an enormously entertaining movie , like nothing we've ever seen before , and yet completely familiar .
443	partway through watching this saccharine , easter-egg-colored concoction , you realize that it is made up of three episodes of a rejected tv show .
444	in the real world , an actor this uncharismatically beautiful would have a résumé loaded with credits like " girl in bar #3 . "
445	a porn film without the sex scenes .
446	this thing is virtually unwatchable .
447	coupling disgracefully written dialogue with flailing bodily movements that substitute for acting , circuit is the awkwardly paced soap opera-ish story .
448	the humor and humanity of monsoon wedding are in perfect balance .
449	whereas the extremely competent hitman films such as pulp fiction and get shorty resonate a sardonic verve to their caustic purpose for existing , who is cletis tout ? is an inexpressible and drab wannabe looking for that exact niche .
450	bound to appeal to women looking for a howlingly trashy time .
451	a era do gelo diverte , mas não convence . É um passatempo descompromissado – e só .
452	this is wild surreal stuff , but brilliant and the camera just kind of sits there and lets you look at this and its like you're going from one room to the next and none of them have any relation to the other .
453	if you think it's a riot to see rob schneider in a young woman's clothes , then you'll enjoy the hot chick .
454	wait for pay per view or rental but don't dismiss barbershop out of hand .
455	how do you spell cliché ?
456	a distinctly minor effort that will be seen to better advantage on cable , especially considering its barely feature-length running time of one hour .
457	it comes off as so silly that you wouldn't be surprised if ba , murdock and rest of the a-team were seen giving chase in a black and red van .
458	one of the best films of the year with its exploration of the obstacles to happiness faced by five contemporary individuals . . . a psychological masterpiece .
459	even as lame horror flicks go , this is lame .
460	despite the holes in the story and the somewhat predictable plot , moments of the movie caused me to jump in my chair . . .
461	will only satisfy those who can't tell the difference between the good , the bad and the ugly .
462	howard conjures the past via surrealist flourishes so overwrought you'd swear he just stepped out of a buñuel retrospective .
463	though it is by no means his best work , laissez-passer is a distinguished and distinctive effort by a bona-fide master , a fascinating film replete with rewards to be had by all willing to make the effort to reap them .
464	brainy , artistic and muted , almost to the point of suffocation .
465	like the best 60 minutes exposé , the film ( at 80 minutes ) is actually quite entertaining .
466	aggravating and tedious .
467	forget about one oscar nomination for julianne moore this year - she should get all five .
468	the fluid motion is astounding on any number of levels -- including the physical demands made on büttner -- and it implies in its wake the intractable , irreversible flow of history .
469	at times auto focus feels so distant you might as well be watching it through a telescope . yet in its own aloof , unreachable way it's so fascinating you won't be able to look away for a second .
470	serious movie-goers embarking upon this journey will find that the road to perdition leads to a satisfying destination .
471	a movie like the guys is why film criticism can be considered work .
472	the stripped-down approach does give the film a certain timeless quality , but the measured pace and lack of dramatic inflection can also seem tedious .
473	a fantastic premise anchors this movie , but what it needs is either a more rigid , blair witch-style commitment to its mockumentary format , or a more straightforward , dramatic treatment , with all the grandiosity that that implies .
474	earnest falls short of its ideal predecessor largely due to parker's ill-advised meddling with the timeless source material .
475	what soured me on the santa clause 2 was that santa bumps up against 21st century reality so hard , it's icky .
476	i can't remember the last time i saw an audience laugh so much during a movie , but there's only one problem…it's supposed to be a drama .
477	a well-done film of a self-reflexive , philosophical nature .
478	a shame that stealing harvard is too busy getting in its own way to be anything but frustrating , boring , and forgettable .
479	been there , done that . . . a thousand times already , and better .
480	the performances are uniformly good .
481	the members manage to pronounce kok exactly as you think they might , thus giving the cast ample opportunity to use that term as often as possible . it's very beavis and butthead , yet always seems to elicit a chuckle .
482	oversexed , at times overwrought comedy/drama that offers little insight into the experience of being forty , female and single .
483	schrader examines crane's decline with unblinking candor .
484	a jaw-droppingly beautiful work that upends nearly every cliché of japanese animation while delivering a more than satisfactory amount of carnage .
485	from the dull , surreal ache of mortal awareness emerges a radiant character portrait .
486	my little eye is the best little " horror " movie i've seen in years .
487	sandra bullock and hugh grant make a great team , but this predictable romantic comedy should get a pink slip .
488	when it really counts . . . bloody sunday connects on a visceral level that transcends language .
489	the first shocking thing about sorority boys is that it's actually watchable . even more baffling is that it's funny .
490	. . . too sappy for its own good .
491	unexpected moments of authentically impulsive humor are the hallmark of this bittersweet , uncommonly sincere movie that portrays the frank humanity of…emotional recovery .
492	like brosnan's performance , evelyn comes from the heart .
493	an original gem about an obsession with time .
494	nothing debases a concept comedy quite like the grinding of bad ideas , and showtime is crammed full of them .
495	a terrific date movie , whatever your orientation .
496	thoughtless , random , superficial humour and a lot of very bad scouse accents
497	doesn't add up to much .
498	how on earth , or anywhere else , did director ron underwood manage to blow $100 million on this ?
499	jones . . . does offer a brutal form of charisma .
500	one of recent memory's most thoughtful films about art , ethics , and the cost of moral compromise .
501	significantly better than its 2002 children's-movie competition .
502	. . . is funny in the way that makes you ache with sadness ( the way chekhov is funny ) , profound without ever being self-important , warm without ever succumbing to sentimentality .
503	you walk out of the good girl with mixed emotions — disapproval of justine combined with a tinge of understanding for her actions .
504	limps along on a squirm-inducing fish-out-of-water formula that goes nowhere and goes there very , very slowly .
505	exactly what its title implies : lusty , boisterous and utterly charming .
506	it is parochial , accessible to a chosen few , standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill
507	manipulative claptrap , a period-piece movie-of-the-week , plain old blarney . . . take your pick . all three descriptions suit evelyn , a besotted and obvious drama that tells us nothing new .
508	the sight of the spaceship on the launching pad is duly impressive in imax dimensions , as are shots of the astronauts floating in their cabins .
509	[sam's] self-flagellation is more depressing than entertaining .

524	the chateau belongs to rudd , whose portrait of a therapy-dependent flakeball spouting french malapropisms . . . is a nonstop hoot .
525	its simplicity puts an exclamation point on the fact that this isn't something to be taken seriously , but it also wrecks any chance of the movie rising above similar fare .
526	a welcome relief from baseball movies that try too hard to be mythic , this one is a sweet and modest and ultimately winning story .

568	the performances are strong , though the subject matter demands acting that borders on hammy at times .
569	although trying to balance self-referential humor and a normal ol' slasher plot seemed like a decent endeavor , the result doesn't fully satisfy either the die-hard jason fans or those who can take a good joke .
570	the actresses may have worked up a back story for the women they portray so convincingly , but viewers don't get enough of that background for the characters to be involving as individuals rather than types .
571	if there's a heaven for bad movies , deuces wild is on its way .
572	i encourage young and old alike to go see this unique and entertaining twist on the classic whale's tale -- you won't be sorry !
573	remarkable for its excellent storytelling , its economical , compressed characterisations and for its profound humanity , it's an adventure story and history lesson all in one .
574	it's a refreshing change from the self-interest and paranoia that shape most american representations of castro .
575	nothing can detract from the affection of that moral favorite : friends will be friends through thick and thin .

577	exciting and direct , with ghost imagery that shows just enough to keep us on our toes .
578	a very slow , uneventful ride around a pretty tattered old carousel .
579	. . . while certainly clever in spots , this too-long , spoofy update of shakespeare's macbeth doesn't sustain a high enough level of invention .
580	the film's welcome breeziness and some unbelievably hilarious moments -- most portraying the idiocy of the film industry -- make it mostly worth the trip .
581	it will grip even viewers who aren't interested in rap , as it cuts to the heart of american society in an unnerving way .
582	instead of using george and lucy's most obvious differences to ignite sparks , lawrence desperately looks elsewhere , seizing on george's haplessness and lucy's personality tics .
583	disjointed parody .
584	it's the movie equivalent of a sweaty old guy in a rain coat shopping for cheap porn .
585	this is a happy throwback to the time when cartoons were cinema's most idiosyncratic form instead of one of its most predictable .

596	the jokes are flat , and the action looks fake .
597	it's a diverting enough hour-and-a-half for the family audience .
598	it is a comedy that's not very funny and an action movie that is not very thrilling ( and an uneasy alliance , at that ) .
599	every good actor needs to do his or her own hamlet . for benigni it wasn't shakespeare whom he wanted to define his career with but pinocchio . it might as well have been problem child iv .
600	my wife is an actress has its moments in looking at the comic effects of jealousy . in the end , though , it is only mildly amusing when it could have been so much more .
601	the tale of tok ( andy lau ) , a sleek sociopath on the trail of o ( takashi sorimachi ) , the most legendary of asian hitmen , is too scattershot to take hold .
602	too lazy to take advantage of its semi-humorous premise .
603	the strength of the film lies in its two central performances by sven wollter as the stricken composer and viveka seldahl as his desperate violinist wife .
604	what happens when something goes bump in the night and nobody cares ?
605	resourceful and ingenious entertainment .
606	it's not a particularly good film , but neither is it a monsterous one .
607	an unintentional parody of every teen movie made in the last five years .
608	ensemble movies , like soap operas , depend on empathy . if there ain't none , you have a problem .
609	even if you don't understand what on earth is going on , this is a movie that will stimulate hours of post viewing discussion , if only to be reminded of who did what to whom and why .
610	a clutchy , indulgent and pretentious travelogue and diatribe against . . . well , just stuff . watching scarlet diva , one is poised for titillation , raw insight or both . instead , we just get messy anger , a movie as personal therapy .
611	a smart and funny , albeit sometimes superficial , cautionary tale of a technology in search of an artist .
612	duvall is strong as always .
613	the film can depress you about life itself .
614	his [nelson's] screenplay needs some serious re-working to show more of the dilemma , rather than have his characters stage shouting matches about it .
615	the movie quickly drags on becoming boring and predictable . i tried to read the time on my watch .
616	an edifying glimpse into the wit and revolutionary spirit of these performers and their era .
617	a sha-na-na sketch punctuated with graphic violence .
618	a plodding look at the french revolution through the eyes of aristocrats .
619	a vile , incoherent mess . . . a scummy ripoff of david cronenberg's brilliant 'videodrome . '
620	desperately unfunny when it tries to makes us laugh and desperately unsuspenseful when it tries to make us jump out of our seats .
621	stale and clichéd to a fault .
622	highlights are the terrific performances by christopher plummer , as the prime villain , and nathan lane as vincent crummles , the eccentric theater company manager .
623	this ludicrous film is predictable at every turn .
624	the movie's relatively simple plot and uncomplicated morality play well with the affable cast .
625	this is rote drivel aimed at mom and dad's wallet .
626	rarely has leukemia looked so shimmering and benign .
627	the pain , loneliness and insecurity of the screenwriting process are vividly and painfully brought to slovenly life in this self-deprecating , biting and witty feature written by charlie kaufman and his twin brother , donald , and directed by spike jonze .
628	it's a much more emotional journey than what shyamalan has given us in his past two movies , and gibson , stepping in for bruce willis , is the perfect actor to take us on the trip .
629	there are things to like about murder by numbers -- but , in the end , the disparate elements don't gel .
630	tsai ming-liang has taken his trademark style and refined it to a crystalline point .
631	the real question this movie poses is not 'who ? ' but 'why ? '
632	fear dot com is so rambling and disconnected it never builds any suspense .
633	ranges from laugh-out-loud hilarious to wonder-what- time-it-is tedious .
634	it may not be history – but then again , what if it is ? – but it makes for one of the most purely enjoyable and satisfying evenings at the movies i've had in a while .
635	the best film about baseball to hit theaters since field of dreams .
636	it has charm to spare , and unlike many romantic comedies , it does not alienate either gender in the audience .
637	goofy , nutty , consistently funny . and educational !
638	while the plot follows a predictable connect-the-dots course . . . director john schultz colors the picture in some evocative shades .
639	para hitler , o mundo era sua tela ; e o horror , seu pincel . e max retrata este fato com elegante abandono , numa triste constatação da realidade histórica .
640	the casting of raymond j . barry as the 'assassin' greatly enhances the quality of neil burger's impressive fake documentary .
641	rodriguez does a splendid job of racial profiling hollywood style--casting excellent latin actors of all ages--a trend long overdue .
642	nothing short of wonderful with its ten-year-old female protagonist and its steadfast refusal to set up a dualistic battle between good and evil .
643	a grimly competent and stolid and earnest military courtroom drama .
644	davis the performer is plenty fetching enough , but she needs to shake up the mix , and work in something that doesn't feel like a half-baked stand-up routine .
645	director barry skolnick and his screenwriters glibly tick off every point of " the longest yard " playbook like a checklist .
646	[leigh] has a true talent for drawing wrenching performances from his actors ( improvised over many months ) and for conveying the way tiny acts of kindness make ordinary life survivable .
647	lástima por schwarzenegger , pero es hora de que deje la estafeta a las nuevas generaciones .
648	director elie chouraqui , who co-wrote the script , catches the chaotic horror of war , but why bother if you're going to subjugate truth to the tear-jerking demands of soap opera ?
649	the film makes a fatal mistake : it asks us to care about a young man whose only apparent virtue is that he is not quite as unpleasant as some of the people in his life .
650	director yu seems far more interested in gross-out humor than in showing us well-thought stunts or a car chase that we haven't seen 10 , 000 times .
651	these characters are so well established that the gang feels comfortable with taking insane liberties and doing the goofiest stuff out of left field , and i'm all for that .
652	[sports] admirable energy , full-bodied characterizations and narrative urgency .
653	these people wouldn't know subtle characterization if it put on a giant furry monster costume and then gave them a lapdance .
654	consists of a plot and jokes done too often by people far more talented than ali g
655	the film meant well in its horse tale about freedom , but wasn't able to reach the heart because it was too overbearing .
656	the climactic events are so well realized that you may forget all about the original conflict , just like the movie does
657	despite the pyrotechnics , narc is strictly by the book .
658	[w]hile long on amiable monkeys and worthy environmentalism , jane goodall's wild chimpanzees is short on the thrills the oversize medium demands .
659	there's more scatological action in 8 crazy nights than a proctologist is apt to encounter in an entire career .
660	[schweiger is] talented and terribly charismatic , qualities essential to both movie stars and social anarchists .
661	as a thoughtful and unflinching examination of an alternative lifestyle , sex with strangers is a success .
662	charlotte sometimes is a gem . it's always enthralling .
663	[seems] even more uselessly redundant and shamelessly money-grubbing than most third-rate horror sequels .
664	it's traditional moviemaking all the way , but it's done with a lot of careful period attention as well as some very welcome wit .
665	i hope the movie is widely seen and debated with appropriate ferocity and thoughtfulness .
666	you wouldn't want to live waydowntown , but it is a hilarious place to visit .
667	meant to reduce blake's philosophy into a tragic coming-of-age saga punctuated by bursts of animator todd mcfarlane's superhero dystopia .
668	the story is far-flung , illogical , and plain stupid .
669	an exquisitely crafted and acted tale .
670	rodriguez has the chops of a smart-aleck film school brat and the imagination of a big kid . . .
671	jirí hubac's script is a gem . his characters are engaging , intimate and the dialogue is realistic and greatly moving . the scope of the silberstein family is large and we grow attached to their lives , full of strength , warmth and vitality . .
672	by the final whistle you're convinced that this mean machine was a decent tv outing that just doesn't have big screen magic .
673	like a precious and finely cut diamond , magnificent to behold in its sparkling beauty yet in reality it's one tough rock .
674	starts slowly , but adrien brody – in the title role – helps make the film's conclusion powerful and satisfying .
675	how many more times will indie filmmakers subject us to boring , self-important stories of how horrible we are to ourselves and each other ?
676	. . . a polished and relatively sincere piece of escapism .
677	occasionally loud and offensive , but more often , it simply lulls you into a gentle waking coma .
678	at best this is a film for the under-7 crowd . but it would be better to wait for the video . and a very rainy day .
679	now as a former gong show addict , i'll admit it , my only complaint is that we didn't get more re-creations of all those famous moments from the show .
680	the chateau is a risky venture that never quite goes where you expect and often surprises you with unexpected comedy .
681	it may sound like a mere disease-of- the-week tv movie , but a song for martin is made infinitely more wrenching by the performances of real-life spouses seldahl and wollter .
682	well-nigh unendurable . . . though the picture strains to become cinematic poetry , it remains depressingly prosaic and dull .
683	a good-natured ensemble comedy that tries hard to make the most of a bumper cast , but never quite gets off the ground .
684	it would be churlish to begrudge anyone for receiving whatever consolation that can be found in dragonfly , yet it is impossible to find the film anything but appalling , shamelessly manipulative and contrived , and totally lacking in conviction .
685	4 friends , 2 couples , 2000 miles , and all the pabst blue ribbon beer they can drink - it's the ultimate redneck road-trip .
686	you needn't be steeped in '50s sociology , pop culture or movie lore to appreciate the emotional depth of haynes' work . though haynes' style apes films from the period . . . its message is not rooted in that decade .
687	there's nothing like love to give a movie a b-12 shot , and cq shimmers with it .
688	an absurdist spider web .
689	the solid filmmaking and convincing characters makes this a high water mark for this genre .
690	an old-fashioned drama of substance about a teacher's slide down the slippery slope of dishonesty after an encounter with the rich and the powerful who have nothing but disdain for virtue .
691	it's one of those baseball pictures where the hero is stoic , the wife is patient , the kids are as cute as all get-out and the odds against success are long enough to intimidate , but short enough to make a dream seem possible .
692	ourside the theatre roger might be intolerable company , but inside it he's well worth spending some time with .
693	animated drivel meant to enhance the self-image of drooling idiots .
694	whenever its story isn't bogged down by idiocy involving the cia and a lost u . s . satellite , hunter -- starring irwin and his american wife/colleague , terri -- is a movie children should enjoy .
695	intelligent , caustic take on a great writer and dubious human being .
696	vividly conveys both the pitfalls and the pleasures of over-the-top love .
697	a film of empty , fetishistic violence in which murder is casual and fun .
698	it's a beautiful film , full of elaborate and twisted characters - and it's also pretty funny .
699	the acting is just fine , but there's not enough substance here to sustain interest for the full 90 minutes , especially with the weak payoff .
700	the rich performances by friel -- and especially williams , an american actress who becomes fully english -- round out the square edges .
701	the plot is straight off the shelf , the performances are television- caliber and the message of providing solace through deception is a little creepy .
702	more dutiful than enchanting . . . terribly episodic and lacking the spark of imagination that might have made it an exhilarating treat .
703	a listless sci-fi comedy in which eddie murphy deploys two guises and elaborate futuristic sets to no particularly memorable effect .
704	if the predictability of bland comfort food appeals to you , then the film is a pleasant enough dish .
705	even film silliness needs a little gravity , beyond good hair and humping .
706	birthday girl doesn't try to surprise us with plot twists , but rather seems to enjoy its own transparency .
707	the irwins' scenes are fascinating ; the movie as a whole is cheap junk and an insult to their death-defying efforts .
708	fun and nimble .
709	the film is a travesty of the genre and even as spoof takes itself too seriously .
710	left me with the visceral sensation of longing , lasting traces of charlotte's web of desire and desperation .
711	whether jason x is this bad on purpose is never clear . but one thing's for sure : it never comes close to being either funny or scary .
712	'the château is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot . '
713	shadyac shoots his film like an m . night shyamalan movie , and he frequently maintains the same snail's pace ; he just forgot to add any genuine tension .
714	[reaches] wholly believable and heart-wrenching depths of despair .
715	jonah is only so-so . . . the addition of a biblical message will either improve the film for you , or it will lessen it .
716	i'm sure the filmmaker would disagree , but , honestly , i don't see the point . it's a visual rorschach test and i must have failed .
717	shyamalan offers copious hints along the way -- myriad signs , if you will -- that beneath the familiar , funny surface is a far bigger , far more meaningful story than one in which little green men come to earth for harvesting purposes .
718	a taut psychological thriller that doesn't waste a moment of its two-hour running time .
719	we started to wonder if … some unpaid intern had just typed 'chris rock , ' 'anthony hopkins' and 'terrorists' into some univac-like script machine .
720	everyone connected to this movie seems to be part of an insider clique , which tends to breed formulaic films rather than fresh ones .
721	bielinsky is a filmmaker of impressive talent .
722	most consumers of lo mein and general tso's chicken barely give a thought to the folks who prepare and deliver it , so , hopefully , this film will attach a human face to all those little steaming cartons .
723	kiarostami has crafted a deceptively casual ode to children and managed to convey a tiny sense of hope .
724	a moving and important film .
725	the movie is about as humorous as watching your favorite pet get buried alive .
726	hatosy . . . portrays young brendan with his usual intelligence and subtlety , not to mention a convincing brogue .
727	a playful iranian parable about openness , particularly the need for people of diverse political perspectives to get along despite their ideological differences .
728	responsável direto pelo fracasso 'artístico' de doce lar , o roteirista c . jay cox não consegue sequer aproveitar os pouquíssimos momentos em que escapa da mediocridade .
729	a soggy , shapeless mess . . . just a dumb excuse for a waterlogged equivalent of a haunted-house movie .
730	even as it pays earnest homage to turntablists and beat jugglers , old schoolers and current innovators , scratch is great fun , full of the kind of energy it's documenting .
731	a thriller made from a completist's checklist rather than with a cultist's passion .
732	handled correctly , wilde's play is a masterpiece of elegant wit and artifice . here , alas , it collapses like an overcooked soufflé .
733	not a film for the faint of heart or conservative of spirit , but for the rest of us -- especially san francisco lovers -- it's a spirited film and a must-see .
734	sheridan seems terrified of the book's irreverent energy , and scotches most of its élan , humor , bile , and irony .
735	an elegant film with often surprising twists and an intermingling of naiveté and sophistication .
736	ao sair do cinema , eu estava feliz e com saudades de um tempo em que , para mim , a existência de papai noel era um fato inquestionável .
737	although devoid of objectivity and full of nostalgic comments from the now middle-aged participants , dogtown and z-boys has a compelling story to tell .
738	. . . pays tribute to heroes the way julia roberts hands out awards--with phony humility barely camouflaging grotesque narcissism .
739	wise and deadpan humorous .
740	a 94-minute travesty of unparalleled proportions , writer-director parker seems to go out of his way to turn the legendary wit's classic mistaken identity farce into brutally labored and unfunny hokum .
741	not only unfunny , but downright repellent .
742	what might've been an exhilarating exploration of an odd love triangle becomes a sprawl of uncoordinated vectors .
743	if you can read the subtitles ( the opera is sung in italian ) and you like 'masterpiece theatre' type costumes , you'll enjoy this movie .
744	comes off like a bad imitation of the bard .
745	it's a testament to de niro and director michael caton-jones that by movie's end , we accept the characters and the film , flaws and all .
746	while van wilder may not be the worst national lampoon film , it's far from being this generation's animal house .
747	bogdanovich tantalizes by offering a peep show into the lives of the era's creme de la celluloid .
748	the santa clause 2 is a barely adequate babysitter for older kids , but i've got to give it thumbs down .
749	pull[s] off the rare trick of recreating not only the look of a certain era , but also the feel .
750	the documentary does little , apart from raising the topic , to further stoke the conversation .
751	even better than the first one !
752	though this rude and crude film does deliver a few gut-busting laughs , its digs at modern society are all things we've seen before .
753	the plot is nothing but boilerplate clichés from start to finish , and the script assumes that not only would subtlety be lost on the target audience , but that it's also too stupid to realize that they've already seen this exact same movie a hundred times
754	a by-the-numbers effort that won't do much to enhance the franchise .
755	a minor work yet there's no denying the potency of miller's strange , fleeting brew of hopeful perseverance and hopeless closure .
756	the affectionate loopiness that once seemed congenital to demme's perspective has a tough time emerging from between the badly dated cutesy-pie mystery scenario and the newfangled hollywood post-production effects .
757	if you're the kind of parent who enjoys intentionally introducing your kids to films which will cause loads of irreparable damage that years and years of costly analysis could never fix , i have just one word for you -– decasia
758	a moving and weighty depiction of one family's attempts to heal after the death of a child .
759	a incompetência de marcus adams como roteirista só é superada por sua péssima direção .
760	charming and funny ( but ultimately silly ) movie .
761	it's a stale , overused cocktail using the same olives since 1962 as garnish . not only is entry number twenty the worst of the brosnan bunch , it's one of the worst of the entire franchise .
762	there's a neat twist , subtly rendered , that could have wrapped things up at 80 minutes , but kang tacks on three or four more endings .
763	a journey through memory , a celebration of living , and a sobering rumination on fatality , classism , and ignorance .
764	the film grows on you . and how .
765	graças às interações entre seus personagens , o filme torna-se não apenas uma história divertida sobre uma curiosa perseguição , mas também um belo estudo de personagens .
766	. . . creates a visceral sense of its characters' lives and conflicted emotions that carries it far above . . . what could have been a melodramatic , lifetime channel-style anthology .
767	without ever becoming didactic , director carlos carrera expertly weaves this novelistic story of entangled interrelationships and complex morality .
768	. . . no charm , no laughs , no fun , no reason to watch .
769	katz's documentary doesn't have much panache , but with material this rich it doesn't need it .
770	an intimate contemplation of two marvelously messy lives .
771	[jeff's] gorgeous , fluid compositions , underlined by neil finn and edmund mcwilliams's melancholy music , are charged with metaphor , but rarely easy , obvious or self-indulgent .
772	'you'll laugh for not quite and hour and a half , but come out feeling strangely unsatisfied . you'll feel like you ate a reeses without the peanut butter . . . '
773	a stupid , derivative horror film that substitutes extreme gore for suspense .
774	stinks from start to finish , like a wet burlap sack of gloom .
775	brady achieves the remarkable feat of squandering a topnotch foursome of actors . . . by shoving them into every clichéd white-trash situation imaginable .
776	off the hook is overlong and not well-acted , but credit writer-producer-director adam watstein with finishing it at all .
777	a clichéd and shallow cautionary tale about the hard-partying lives of gay men .
778	fails to satisfactorily exploit its gender politics , genre thrills or inherent humor .
779	five screenwriters are credited with the cliché-laden screenplay ; it seems as if each watered down the version of the one before .
780	a bold and subversive film that cuts across the grain of what is popular and powerful in this high-tech age , speaking its truths with spellbinding imagery and the entrancing music of philip glass .
781	warm in its loving yet unforgivingly inconsistent depiction of everyday people , relaxed in its perfect quiet pace and proud in its message . i loved this film .
782	comes across as a relic from a bygone era , and its convolutions . . . feel silly rather than plausible .
783	instead of making his own style , director marcus adams just copies from various sources – good sources , bad mixture
784	a manipulative feminist empowerment tale thinly posing as a serious drama about spousal abuse .
785	starts out ballsy and stylish but fails to keep it up and settles into clichés .
786	may not be a breakthrough in filmmaking , but it is unwavering and arresting .
787	it's excessively quirky and a little underconfident in its delivery , but otherwise this is the best 'old neighborhood' project since christopher walken kinda romanced cyndi lauper in the opportunists .
788	. . . standard guns versus martial arts cliche with little new added .
789	very predictable but still entertaining
790	davis . . . gets vivid performances from her cast and pulls off some deft ally mcbeal-style fantasy sequences .
791	what makes how i killed my father compelling , besides its terrific performances , is fontaine's willingness to wander into the dark areas of parent-child relationships without flinching .
792	pretty much sucks , but has a funny moment or two .
793	whereas last year's exemplary sexy beast seemed to revitalize the british gangster movie , this equally brutal outing merely sustains it .
794	we want the funk - and this movie's got it .
795	what kids will discover is a new collectible . what parents will suspect is that they're watching a 76-minute commercial .
796	there are some laughs in this movie , but williams' anarchy gets tiresome , the satire is weak .
797	festers in just such a dungpile that you'd swear you were watching monkeys flinging their feces at you .
798	the animation and game phenomenon that peaked about three years ago is actually dying a slow death , if the poor quality of pokemon 4 ever is any indication .
799	nohe has made a decent 'intro' documentary , but he feels like a spectator and not a participant .
800	a pretty funny movie , with most of the humor coming , as before , from the incongruous but chemically perfect teaming of crystal and de niro .
801	the trinity assembly approaches the endeavor with a shocking lack of irony , and george ratliff's documentary , hell house , reflects their earnestness — which makes for a terrifying film .
802	a moody , multi-dimensional love story and sci-fi mystery , solaris is a thought-provoking , haunting film that allows the seeds of the imagination to germinate .
803	runs on the pure adrenalin of pacino's performance .
804	when it's not wallowing in hormonal melodrama , " real women have curves " is a sweet , honest , and enjoyable comedy-drama about a young woman who wants many things in life , but fears she'll become her mother before she gets to fulfill her dreams .
805	sushi for the connoisseurs of the macabre .
806	the emperor's club is one of those films that possesses all the good intentions in the world , but . . .
807	it's a remarkably solid and subtly satirical tour de force .
808	the banter between calvin and his fellow barbers feels like a streetwise mclaughlin group . . . and never fails to entertain .
809	. . . strips bible stores of the potential for sanctimoniousness , making them meaningful for both kids and church-wary adults .
810	. . . the good and different idea [of middle-aged romance] is not handled well and , except for the fine star performances , there is little else to recommend " never again . "
811	show me the mugging .
812	morton uses her face and her body language to bring us morvern's soul , even though the character is almost completely deadpan .
813	michel piccoli's moving performance is this films reason for being .
814	ultimately , the message of trouble every day seems to be that all sexual desire disrupts life's stasis .
815	what could have become just another cautionary fable is allowed to play out as a clever , charming tale – as pleasantly in its own way as its self-dramatizing characters .
816	there are plot holes big enough for shamu the killer whale to swim through .
817	a mess when it comes to the characters and writing . . . but works its way underneath the skin like few movies have in recent memory .
818	exposing the ways we fool ourselves is one hour photo's real strength .
819	in some ways , lagaan is quintessential bollywood . except it's much , much better .
820	as crimes go , writer-director michael kalesniko's how to kill your neighbor's dog is slight but unendurable .
821	has all the hallmarks of a movie designed strictly for children's home video , a market so insatiable it absorbs all manner of lame entertainment , as long as 3-year-olds find it diverting .
822	a fascinating , unnerving examination of the delusions of one unstable man .
823	" one look at a girl in tight pants and big tits and you turn stupid ? " um… . . isn't that the basis for the entire plot ?
824	the talented and clever robert rodriguez perhaps put a little too much heart into his first film and didn't reserve enough for his second .
825	it's a fine , focused piece of work that reopens an interesting controversy and never succumbs to sensationalism .
826	though clearly well-intentioned , this cross-cultural soap opera is painfully formulaic and stilted .
827	while it may not add up to the sum of its parts , holofcener's film offers just enough insight to keep it from being simpleminded , and the ensemble cast is engaging enough to keep you from shifting in your chair too often .
828	it will break your heart many times over .
829	spousal abuse is a major problem in contemporary society , but the film reduces this domestic tragedy to florid melodrama .
830	it is a challenging film , if not always a narratively cohesive one .
831	nothing in waking up in reno ever inspired me to think of its inhabitants as anything more than markers in a screenplay .
832	a subject like this should inspire reaction in its audience ; the pianist does not .
833	to better understand why this didn't connect with me would require another viewing , and i won't be sitting through this one again . . . that in itself is commentary enough .
834	the cast has a high time , but de broca has little enthusiasm for such antique pulp .
835	a candid and often fascinating documentary about a pentecostal church in dallas that assembles an elaborate haunted house each year to scare teenagers into attending services .
836	what full frontal lacks in thematic coherence it largely makes up for as loosey-goosey , experimental entertainment . still , i'm not quite sure what the point is
837	pc stability notwithstanding , the film suffers from a simplistic narrative and a pat , fairy-tale conclusion .
838	it's sincere to a fault , but , unfortunately , not very compelling or much fun .
839	its audacious ambitions sabotaged by pomposity , steven soderbergh's space opera emerges as a numbingly dull experience .
840	disappointing in comparison to other recent war movies…or any other john woo flick for that matter .
841	the tone shifts abruptly from tense to celebratory to soppy .
842	it bites hard .
843	isn't as sharp as the original . . . despite some visual virtues , 'blade ii' just doesn't cut it .
844	. . . the movie is just a plain old monster .
845	brash , intelligent and erotically perplexing , haneke's portrait of an upper class austrian society and the suppression of its tucked away demons is uniquely felt with a sardonic jolt .
846	frankly , it's pretty stupid . i had more fun with ben stiller's zoolander , which i thought was rather clever . but there's plenty to offend everyone . . .
847	complex , affecting and uniquely almodóvar , the film evokes strong emotions and pushes viewers to question their deepest notions of moral right and wrong .
848	shattering , devastating documentary on two maladjusted teens in a downward narcotized spiral . extraordinary debut from josh koury .
849	the lack of naturalness makes everything seem self-consciously poetic and forced . . . it's a pity that [nelson's] achievement doesn't match his ambition .
850	an enthralling , playful film that constantly frustrates our desire to know the 'truth' about this man , while deconstructing the very format of the biography in a manner that derrida would doubtless give his blessing to .
851	better than the tepid star trek : insurrection ; falls short of first contact because the villain couldn't pick the lint off borg queen alice krige's cape ; and finishes half a parsec ( a nose ) ahead of generations .
852	the script is too mainstream and the psychology too textbook to intrigue .
853	this english-language version . . . does full honor to miyazaki's teeming and often unsettling landscape , and to the conflicted complexity of his characters .
854	made me feel uneasy , even queasy , because [solondz's] cool compassion is on the border of bemused contempt .
855	hollywood has taken quite a nosedive from alfred hitchcock's imaginative flight to shyamalan's self-important summer fluff .
856	the movie has generic virtues , and despite a lot of involved talent , seems done by the numbers .
857	it plods along methodically , somehow under the assumption that its " dead wife communicating from beyond the grave " framework is even remotely new or interesting .
858	nothing's at stake , just a twisty double-cross you can smell a mile away--still , the derivative nine queens is lots of fun .
859	it might not be 1970s animation , but everything else about it is straight from the saturday morning cartoons – a retread story , bad writing , and the same old silliness .
860	befuddled in its characterizations as it begins to seem as long as the two year affair which is its subject
861	drug abuse , infidelity and death aren't usually comedy fare , but turpin's film allows us to chuckle through the angst .
862	generates an enormous feeling of empathy for its characters .
863	don't wait to see this terrific film with your kids -- if you don't have kids borrow some .
864	dark , resonant , inventively detailed and packed with fleet turns of plot and a feast of visual amazement .
865	a loud , low-budget and tired formula film that arrives cloaked in the euphemism 'urban drama . '
866	. . . by the time it's done with us , mira nair's new movie has its audience giddy with the delight of discovery , of having been immersed in a foreign culture only to find that human nature is pretty much the same all over .
867	angel presents events partly from the perspective of aurelie and christelle , and infuses the film with the sensibility of a particularly nightmarish fairytale .
868	the redeeming feature of chan's films has always been the action , but the stunts in the tuxedo seem tired and , what's worse , routine .
869	neither a rousing success nor a blinding embarrassment . still , it just sits there like a side dish no one ordered .
870	what starts off as a possible argentine american beauty reeks like a room stacked with pungent flowers .
871	it is too bad that this likable movie isn't more accomplished . the actors try hard but come off too amateurish and awkward .
872	screenwriter chris ver weil's directing debut is good-natured and never dull , but its virtues are small and easily overshadowed by its predictability .
873	" birthday girl " is an actor's movie first and foremost .
874	part of the charm of satin rouge is that it avoids the obvious with humour and lightness .
875	i'm sure the filmmakers found this a remarkable and novel concept , but anybody who has ever seen an independent film can report that it is instead a cheap cliché .
876	there are some fairly unsettling scenes , but they never succeed in really rattling the viewer .
877	one of the best looking and stylish animated movies in quite a while . . .
878	a charming , quirky and leisurely paced scottish comedy -- except with an outrageous central gimmick that could have been a reject from monty python's meaning of life .
879	more mature than fatal attraction , more complete than indecent proposal and more relevant than 9 ½ weeks , unfaithful is at once intimate and universal cinema .
880	there's an energy to y tu mamá también . much of it comes from the brave , uninhibited performances by its lead actors .
881	so devoid of pleasure or sensuality that it cannot even be dubbed hedonistic .
882	call this the full monty on ice , the underdog sports team formula redux .
883	the movie fails to live up to the sum of its parts .
884	waiting for godard can be fruitful : 'in praise of love' is the director's epitaph for himself .
885	a well paced and satisfying little drama that deserved better than a ‘direct-to-video' release .
886	fans of so-bad-they're-good cinema may find some fun in this jumbled mess .
887	i don't know if frailty will turn bill paxton into an a-list director , but he can rest contentedly with the knowledge that he's made at least one damn fine horror movie .
888	all comedy is subversive , but this unrelenting bleak insistence on opting out of any opportunity for finding meaning in relationships or work just becomes sad .
889	while certain cues , like the happy music , suggest that this movie is supposed to warm our hearts , jeong-hyang lee's film is just as likely to blacken that organ with cold vengefulness .
890	" abandon " will leave you wanting to abandon the theater .
891	a lovely and beautifully photographed romance .
892	for more than two decades mr . nachtwey has traveled to places in the world devastated by war , famine and poverty and documented the cruelty and suffering he has found with an devastating , eloquent clarity .
893	i simply can't recommend it enough .
894	the movie does a good job of laying out some of the major issues that we encounter as we journey through life .
895	i felt sad for lise not so much because of what happens as because she was captured by this movie when she obviously belongs in something lighter and sunnier , by rohmer , for example .
896	has enough gun battles and throwaway humor to cover up the yawning chasm where the plot should be .
897	mr . goyer's loose , unaccountable direction is technically sophisticated in the worst way .
898	this overproduced piece of dreck is shockingly bad and absolutely unnecessary . hmmm…might i suggest that the wayward wooden one end it all by stuffing himself into an electric pencil sharpener ?
899	. . . brian de palma is utterly mad : cinema mad , set-piece mad , style mad . it's a beautiful madness .
900	what can one say about a balding 50-year-old actor playing an innocent boy carved from a log ?
901	this examination of aquatic life off the shores of the baja california peninsula of mexico offers an engrossing way to demonstrate the virtues of the imax format .
902	there is no psychology here , and no real narrative logic -- just a series of carefully choreographed atrocities , which become strangely impersonal and abstract .
903	this is simply the most fun you'll ever have with a documentary !
904	it's not as awful as some of the recent hollywood trip tripe . . . but it's far from a groundbreaking endeavor .
905	the film is impressive for the sights and sounds of the wondrous beats the world has to offer .
906	while glover , the irrepressible eccentric of river's edge , dead man and back to the future , is perfect casting for the role , he represents bartleby's main overall flaw .
907	almost everyone growing up believes their family must look like " the addams family " to everyone looking in . . . " my big fat greek wedding " comes from the heart . . .
908	feels like the work of someone who may indeed have finally aged past his prime . . . and , perhaps more than he realizes , just wants to be liked by the people who can still give him work .
909	[cuarón has] created a substantive movie out of several cliched movie structures : the road movie , the coming-of-age movie , and the teenage sex comedy .
910	. . . about as exciting to watch as two last-place basketball teams playing one another on the final day of the season .
911	far too clever by half , howard's film is really a series of strung-together moments , with all the spaces in between filled with fantasies , daydreams , memories and one fantastic visual trope after another .
912	sets up a nice concept for its fiftysomething leading ladies , but fails loudly in execution .
913	a truly wonderful tale combined with stunning animation .
914	pascale bailly's rom-com provides amélie's audrey tautou with another fabuleux destin -- i . e . , a banal spiritual quest .
915	plays like one of those conversations that comic book guy on " the simpsons " has .
916	with so many bad romances out there , this is the kind of movie that deserves a chance to shine .
917	both heartbreaking and heartwarming . . . just a simple fable done in an artless sytle , but it's tremendously moving .
918	wishy-washy .
919	chouraqui brings documentary-like credibility to the horrors of the killing field and the barbarism of 'ethnic cleansing . '
920	if you grew up on scooby -- you'll love this movie . matthew lillard is born to play shaggy !
921	the period -- swinging london in the time of the mods and the rockers -- gets the once-over once again in gangster no . 1 , but falls apart long before the end .
922	shunji iwai's all about lily chou chou is a beautifully shot , but ultimately flawed film about growing up in japan .
923	by and large this is mr . kilmer's movie , and it's his strongest performance since the doors .
924	goyer's screenplay and direction are thankfully understated , and he has drawn excellent performances from his cast .
925	engages us in constant fits of laughter , until we find ourselves surprised at how much we care about the story , and end up walking out not only satisfied but also somewhat touched .
926	[russell] makes good b movies ( the mask , the blob ) , and the scorpion king more than ably meets those standards .
927	another big , dumb action movie in the vein of xxx , the transporter is riddled with plot holes big enough for its titular hero to drive his sleek black bmw through .
928	rich in detail , gorgeously shot and beautifully acted , les destinees is , in its quiet , epic way , daring , inventive and refreshingly unusual .
929	all ms . jovovich , as the sanctified heroine , has to do is look radiant , grimly purposeful and mildly alarmed while forcing open doors , wielding wrenches and fleeing monsters .
930	the movie barely makes sense , with its unbelievable naïveté and arbitrary flashbacks .
931	while the transgressive trappings ( especially the frank sex scenes ) ensure that the film is never dull , rodrigues's beast-within metaphor is ultimately rather silly and overwrought , making the ambiguous ending seem goofy rather than provocative .
932	boyd's screenplay ( co-written with guardian hack nick davies ) has a florid turn of phrase that owes more to guy ritchie than the bard of avon .
933	'god help us , but capra and cooper are rolling over in their graves . '
934	this is amusing for about three minutes .
935	as a randy film about sexy people in gorgeous places being pushed and pulled ( literally and figuratively ) by desire . . . [sex and lucía] makes for an arousing good time .
936	for his first attempt at film noir , spielberg presents a fascinating but flawed look at the near future .
937	. . . enthusiastically invokes the percussion rhythm , the brass soul and the sense of fierce competition that helps make great marching bands half the fun of college football games .
938	falters when it takes itself too seriously and when it depends too heavily on its otherwise talented cast to clown in situations that aren't funny .
939	sometimes smart but more often sophomoric .
940	shows that jackie chan is getting older , and that's something i would rather live in denial about
941	somewhere inside the mess that is world traveler , there is a mediocre movie trying to get out .
942	'aunque recurre a ciertos clichés del género , la poderosa actuación de robin williams perdona las fallas del guión . '
943	" the quiet american " begins in saigon in 1952 . that's its first sign of trouble .
944	gibney and jarecki just want to string the bastard up .
945	consummate actor barry has done excellent work here .
946	catch it . . . if you can !
947	. . . an unimaginative , nasty , glibly cynical piece of work .
948	the story is a rather simplistic one : grief drives her , love drives him , and a second chance to find love in the most unlikely place - it struck a chord in me .
949	enjoy it for what it is ; you can hate yourself later .
950	one thing's for sure—if george romero had directed this movie , it wouldn't have taken the protagonists a full hour to determine that in order to kill a zombie you must shoot it in the head .
951	two hours of melodramatic musical married to two hours of underdog sports intrigue , if the picture also shares the weaknesses of both genres , more's the pity .
952	i liked the movie , but i know i would have liked it more if it had just gone that one step further . i'm left slightly disappointed that it didn't .
953	highly engaging .
954	some remarkable achival film about how shanghai ( of all places ) served jews who escaped the holocaust .
955	a breezy blend of art , history , esoteric musings and philosophy .
956	this is an undeniably intriguing film from an adventurous young talent who finds his inspiration on the fringes of the american underground .
957	. . . bibbidy-bobbidi-bland .
958	a tired , predictable , bordering on offensive , waste of time , money and celluloid .
959	enough trivializes an important crisis , reduces it to an almost comic embarrassment .
960	i've heard that the fans of the first men in black have come away hating the second one . i wonder why . they felt like the same movie to me .
961	absorbing and disturbing -- perhaps more disturbing than originally intended -- but a little clarity would have gone a long way .
962	displaying about equal amounts of naiveté , passion and talent , beneath clouds establishes sen as a filmmaker of considerable potential .
963	talk to her is so darned assured , we have absolutely no idea who the main characters are until the film is well under way -- and yet it's hard to stop watching .
964	director todd solondz has made a movie about critical reaction to his two previous movies , and about his responsibility to the characters that he creates .
965	" not really as bad as you might think ! "
966	a sharp satire of desperation and cinematic deception .
967	feral and uncomfortable .
968	makes one thing abundantly clear . american musical comedy as we know it wouldn't exist without the precedent of yiddish theater , whose jolly , fun-for-fun's-sake communal spirit goes to the essence of broadway .
969	'frailty " starts out like a typical bible killer story , but it turns out to be significantly different ( and better ) than most films with this theme .
970	there's something auspicious , and daring , too , about the artistic instinct that pushes a majority-oriented director like steven spielberg to follow a . i . with this challenging report so liable to unnerve the majority .
971	you could love safe conduct ( laissez passer ) for being a subtitled french movie that is 170 minutes long . you could hate it for the same reason .
972	an incendiary , deeply thought-provoking look at one of the most peculiar ( and peculiarly venomous ) bigotries in our increasingly frightening theocracy
973	what's surprising about this traditional thriller , moderately successful but not completely satisfying , is exactly how genteel and unsurprising the execution turns out to be .
974	has a shambling charm . . . a cheerfully inconsequential diversion .
975	the rock is destined to be the 21st century's new " conan " and that he's going to make a splash even greater than arnold schwarzenegger , jean-claud van damme or steven segal .
976	ultimately too repellent to fully endear itself to american art house audiences , but it is notable for its stylistic austerity and forcefulness .
977	imagine the james woods character from videodrome making a home movie of audrey rose and showing it to the kid from the sixth sense and you've imagined the ring .
978	proves that a movie about goodness is not the same thing as a good movie .
979	for this sort of thing to work , we need agile performers , but the proficient , dull sorvino has no light touch , and rodan is out of his league .
980	an unforgettable look at morality , family , and social expectation through the prism of that omnibus tradition called marriage .
981	it's fun , wispy , wise and surprisingly inoffensive for a film about a teen in love with his stepmom .
982	watching it is rather like viewing a long soap opera in which only the first episode was any good .
983	almost nothing else -- raunchy and graphic as it may be in presentation -- is one-sided , outwardly sexist or mean-spirited . and in a sense , that's a liability .
984	nothing happens , and it happens to flat characters .
985	as lively an account as seinfeld is deadpan .
986	sweet home alabama certainly won't be remembered as one of [witherspoon's] better films .
987	appropriately cynical social commentary aside , #9 never quite ignites .
988	the great pity is that those responsible didn't cut their losses – and ours – and retitle it the adventures of direct-to-video nash , and send it to its proper home .
989	it's possible that something hip and transgressive was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel , but the result is more puzzling than unsettling .
990	lots of effort and intelligence are on display but in execution it is all awkward , static , and lifeless rumblings .
991	stage director sam mendes showcases tom hanks as a depression era hit-man in this dark tale of revenge .
992	what's so fun about this silly , outrageous , ingenious thriller is the director's talent . watching a brian depalma movie is like watching an alfred hitchcock movie after drinking twelve beers .
993	its plot and animation offer daytime tv serviceability , but little more .
994	too sincere to exploit its subjects and too honest to manipulate its audience .
995	it's a good film -- not a classic , but odd , entertaining and authentic .
996	it's a very valuable film . . .
997	more precious than perspicacious
998	a dreary , incoherent , self-indulgent mess of a movie in which a bunch of pompous windbags drone on inanely for two hours . . . a cacophony of pretentious , meaningless prattle .
999	basically a static series of semi-improvised ( and semi-coherent ) raps between the stars .
1000	celebrated at sundance , this slight comedy of manners has winning performances and a glossy , glib charm that's hard to beat .
1001	an ambitious 'what if ? ' that works .
1002	a much more successful translation than its most famous previous film adaptation , writer-director anthony friedman's similarly updated 1970 british production .
1003	kurys never shows why , of all the period's volatile romantic lives , sand and musset are worth particular attention .
1004	charming , if overly complicated . . .
1005	american and european cinema has amassed a vast holocaust literature , but it is impossible to think of any film more challenging or depressing than the grey zone .
1006	a remarkably insightful look at the backstage angst of the stand-up comic .
1007	despite all the talking , by the time the bloody climax arrives we still don't feel enough of an attachment to these guys to care one way or another .
1008	the entire movie is in need of a scented bath .
1009	the film is ultimately about as inspiring as a hallmark card .
1010	in theory , a middle-aged romance pairing clayburgh and tambor sounds promising , but in practice it's something else altogether -- clownish and offensive and nothing at all like real life .
1011	impostor is a step down for director gary fleder .
1012	the film is an earnest try at beachcombing verismo , but it would be even more indistinct than it is were it not for the striking , quietly vulnerable personality of ms . ambrose .
1013	accuracy and realism are terrific , but if your film becomes boring , and your dialogue isn't smart , then you need to use more poetic license .
1014	like its title character , this nicholas nickleby finds itself in reduced circumstances -- and , also like its hero , it remains brightly optimistic , coming through in the end .
1015	travels a fascinating arc from hope and euphoria to reality and disillusionment .
1016	[t]he ideas of revolution #9 are more compelling than the execution
1017	the way coppola professes his love for movies -- both colorful pop junk and the classics that unequivocally qualify as art -- is giddily entertaining .
1018	fans of behan's work and of irish movies in general will be rewarded by borstal boy .
1019	birot's directorial debut ( she co-wrote the script with christophe honoré ) isn't so much bad as it is bland .
1020	contando com uma premissa curiosa , o filme mergulha o espectador em um clima de forte suspense , culminando em um desfecho que certamente fica na memória .
1021	the dialogue is cumbersome , the simpering soundtrack and editing more so .
1022	resident evil is what comes from taking john carpenter's ghosts of mars and eliminating the beheadings . in other words , about as bad a film you're likely to see all year .
1023	no such thing breaks no new ground and treads old turf like a hippopotamus ballerina .
1024	there seems to be no clear path as to where the story's going , or how long it's going to take to get there .
1025	the mushy finale turns john q into a movie-of-the-week tearjerker .
1026	as the movie traces mr . brown's athletic exploits , it is impossible not to be awed by the power and grace of one of the greatest natural sportsmen of modern times .
1027	mr . wollter and ms . seldhal give strong and convincing performances , but neither reaches into the deepest recesses of the character to unearth the quaking essence of passion , grief and fear .
1028	[the film's] taste for " shock humor " will wear thin on all but those weaned on the comedy of tom green and the farrelly brothers .
1029	this horror-comedy doesn't go for the usual obvious laughs at the expense of cheap-looking monsters -- unless you count elvira's hooters .
1030	a metaphor for a modern-day urban china searching for its identity .
1031	schmaltzy and unfunny , adam sandler's cartoon about hanukkah is numbingly bad , little nicky bad , 10 worst list bad .
1032	it's a sweet , laugh-a-minute crowd pleaser that lifts your spirits as well as the corners of your mouth .
1033	in his determination to lighten the heavy subject matter , silberling also , to a certain extent , trivializes the movie with too many nervous gags and pratfalls .
1034	predictable storyline and by-the-book scripting is all but washed away by sumptuous ocean visuals and the cinematic stylings of director john stockwell .
1035	it's a treat – a delightful , witty , improbable romantic comedy with a zippy jazzy score… grant and bullock make it look as though they are having so much fun .
1036	with generic sets and b-grade special effects , jason is about as convincing on the sci-fi front as tv's defunct cleopatra 2525 .
1037	whether or not you're enlightened by any of derrida's lectures on " the other " and " the self , " derrida is an undeniably fascinating and playful fellow .
1038	with or without the sex , a wonderful tale of love and destiny , told well by a master storyteller
1039	directors john musker and ron clements , the team behind the little mermaid , have produced sparkling retina candy , but they aren't able to muster a lot of emotional resonance in the cold vacuum of space .
1040	a delectable and intriguing thriller filled with surprises , read my lips is an original . this is a story of two misfits who don't stand a chance alone , but together they are magnificent .
1041	the premise of " abandon " holds promise , . . . but its delivery is a complete mess .
1042	not a stereotype is omitted nor a cliché left unsaid .
1043	an admitted egomaniac , evans is no hollywood villain , and yet this grating showcase almost makes you wish he'd gone the way of don simpson .
1044	carrying this wafer-thin movie on his nimble shoulders , chan wades through putrid writing , direction and timing with a smile that says , 'if i stay positive , maybe i can channel one of my greatest pictures , drunken master . '
1045	the camera soars above the globe in dazzling panoramic shots that make the most of the large-screen format , before swooping down on a string of exotic locales , scooping the whole world up in a joyous communal festival of rhythm .
1046	mostly martha could have used a little trimming -- 10 or 15 minutes could be cut and no one would notice -- but it's a pleasurable trifle . the only pain you'll feel as the credits roll is your stomach grumbling for some tasty grub .
1047	by turns fanciful , grisly and engagingly quixotic .
1048	it is so earnest , so overwrought and so wildly implausible that it begs to be parodied .
1049	the movie obviously seeks to re-create the excitement of such '50s flicks as jules verne's '20 , 000 leagues under the sea' and the george pal version of h . g . wells' 'the time machine . ' but its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless .
1050	this is the kind of movie that gets a quick release before real contenders arrive in september .
1051	an uneven look into a grim future that doesn't come close to the level of intelligence and visual splendour that can be seen in other films based on philip k . dick stories .
1052	boasts eye-catching art direction but has a forcefully quirky tone that quickly wears out its limited welcome .
1053	the attraction between these two marginal characters is complex from the start -- and , refreshingly , stays that way .
1054	a quaint , romanticized rendering .
1055	absurdities and clichés accumulate like lint in a fat man's navel .
1056	the movie feels like it's going to be great , and it carries on feeling that way for a long time , but takeoff just never happens .
1057	hilarious musical comedy though stymied by accents thick as mud .
1058	the beautifully choreographed kitchen ballet is simple but absorbing .
1059	forget the psychology 101 study of romantic obsession and just watch the procession of costumes in castles and this won't seem like such a bore .
1060	so much about the film is loopy and ludicrous . . . that it could have been a hoot in a bad-movie way if the laborious pacing and endless exposition had been tightened .
1061	the master of disguise represents adam sandler's latest attempt to dumb down the universe .
1062	this is an extraordinary film , not least because it is japanese and yet feels universal .
1063	enormously likable , partly because it is aware of its own grasp of the absurd .
1064	y tu mamá también is hilariously , gloriously alive , and quite often hotter than georgia asphalt .
1065	high crimes knows the mistakes that bad movies make and is determined not to make them , and maybe that is nobility of a sort .
1066	the name says it all . jackass is a vulgar and cheap-looking version of candid camera staged for the marquis de sade set .
1067	imagine a scenario where bergman approaches swedish fatalism using gary larson's far side humor
1068	too intensely focused on the travails of being hal hartley to function as pastiche , no such thing is hartley's least accessible screed yet .
1069	expect the same-old , lame-old slasher nonsense , just with different scenery .
1070	it's an 88-minute highlight reel that's 86 minutes too long .
1071	this is the kind of movie that you only need to watch for about thirty seconds before you say to yourself , 'ah , yes , here we have a bad , bad , bad movie . '
1072	a serviceable euro-trash action extravaganza , with a decent sense of humor and plenty of things that go boom — handguns , bmws and seaside chateaus .
1073	a preposterously melodramatic paean to gang-member teens in brooklyn circa 1958 .
1074	too loud , too long and too frantic by half , die another day suggests that the bond franchise has run into a creative wall that 007 cannot fly over , tunnel under or barrel through .
1075	got some good , organic character work , lots of obvious political insights and little room for engaging , imaginative filmmaking in its nearly 2 1/2-hour , dissipated length .
1076	worthless , from its pseudo-rock-video opening to the idiocy of its last frames .
1077	shrewd but pointless .
1078	so clichéd that , at one point , they literally upset an apple cart .
1079	payne has created a beautiful canvas , and nicholson proves once again that he's the best brush in the business .
1080	time changer may not be the most memorable cinema session but its profound self-evaluation message about our fragile existence and the absence of spiritual guidance should at least invade an abundance of mindsets
1081	[majidi] makes us think twice about immigrants we see around us every day .
1082	takes one character we don't like and another we don't believe , and puts them into a battle of wills that is impossible to care about and isn't very funny .
1083	the plan to make enough into ‘an inspiring tale of survival wrapped in the heart-pounding suspense of a stylish psychological thriller' has flopped as surely as a soufflé gone wrong .
1084	at heart the movie is a deftly wrought suspense yarn whose richer shadings work as coloring rather than substance .
1085	even fans of ismail merchant's work , i suspect , would have a hard time sitting through this one .
1086	some of the visual flourishes are a little too obvious , but restrained and subtle storytelling , and fine performances make this delicate coming-of-age tale a treat .
1087	something akin to a japanese alice through the looking glass , except that it seems to take itself far more seriously .
1088	the gifted crudup has the perfect face to play a handsome blank yearning to find himself , and his cipherlike personality and bad behavior would play fine if the movie knew what to do with him .
1089	admirably ambitious but self-indulgent .
1090	if the film has a problem , its shortness disappoints : you want the story to go on and on .
1091	has little on its mind aside from scoring points with drag gags .
1092	the x potion gives the quickly named blossom , bubbles and buttercup supernatural powers that include extraordinary strength and laser-beam eyes , which unfortunately don't enable them to discern flimsy screenplays .
1093	this remake of lina wertmuller's 1975 eroti-comedy might just be the biggest husband-and-wife disaster since john and bo derek made the ridiculous bolero .
1094	every dance becomes about seduction , where backstabbing and betrayals are celebrated , and sex is currency .
1095	even in its most tedious scenes , russian ark is mesmerizing .
1096	anyone who suffers through this film deserves , at the very least , a big box of consolation candy .
1097	flavorful and romantic , you could call this how martha got her groove back -- assuming , that is , she ever had one to begin with .
1098	the otherwise good-naturedness of mr . deeds , with its embrace of sheer goofiness and cameos of less- than-likely new york celebrities . . . certainly raises the film above anything sandler's been attached to before .
1099	crummy
1100	baby-faced renner is eerily convincing as this bland blank of a man with unimaginable demons within .
1101	a small gem from belgium .
1102	a solid and refined piece of moviemaking imbued with passion and attitude .
1103	what an embarrassment .
1104	the stunt work is top-notch ; the dialogue and drama often food-spittingly funny .
1105	a solidly seaworthy chiller .
1106	charming and witty , it's also somewhat clumsy .
1107	deuces wild is an encyclopedia of cliches that shoplifts shamelessly from farewell-to-innocence movies like the wanderers and a bronx tale without cribbing any of their intelligence .
1108	hawke's film , a boring , pretentious waste of nearly two hours , doesn't tell you anything except that the chelsea hotel today is populated by whiny , pathetic , starving and untalented artistes .
1109	denis forges out of the theories of class- based rage and sisterly obsession a razor-sided tuning fork that rings with cultural , sexual and social discord .
1110	waydowntown manages to nail the spirit-crushing ennui of denuded urban living without giving in to it .
1111	la cinta comienza intentando ser un drama , rápidamente se transforma en una comedia y termina por ser una parodia absolutamente predecible
1112	offers very little genuine romance and even fewer laughs . . . a sad sitcom of a movie , largely devoid of charm .
1113	by not averting his eyes , solondz forces us to consider the unthinkable , the unacceptable , the unmentionable .
1114	jackson is always watchable .
1115	passable enough for a shoot-out in the o . k . court house of life type of flick . strictly middle of the road .
1116	not sweet enough to liven up its predictable story and will leave even fans of hip-hop sorely disappointed .
1117	if hill isn't quite his generation's don siegel ( or robert aldrich ) , it's because there's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair ; it's all bluster and cliché .
1118	weighted down with slow , uninvolving storytelling and flat acting .
1119	a soap-opera quality twist in the last 20 minutes . . . almost puts the kibosh on what is otherwise a sumptuous work of b-movie imagination .
1120	hip-hop rarely comes alive as its own fire-breathing entity in this picture .
1121	my wife's plotting is nothing special ; it's the delivery that matters here .
1122	hartley adds enough quirky and satirical touches in the screenplay to keep the film entertaining .
1123	like any good romance , son of the bride , proves it's never too late to learn .
1124	director oliver parker labors so hard to whip life into the importance of being earnest that he probably pulled a muscle or two .
1125	it smacks of purely commercial motivation , with no great love for the original .
1126	invincible is a wonderful movie .
1127	crush could be the worst film a man has made about women since valley of the dolls .
1128	on the surface , it's a lovers-on-the-run crime flick , but it has a lot in common with piesiewicz's and kieslowski's earlier work , films like the double life of veronique .
1129	if this is cinema , i pledge allegiance to cagney and lacey .
1130	gloriously straight from the vagina .
1131	although i didn't hate this one , it's not very good either . it can be safely recommended as a video/dvd babysitter .
1132	even bigger and more ambitious than the first installment , spy kids 2 looks as if it were made by a highly gifted 12-year-old instead of a grown man .
1133	it tells its story in a flat manner and leaves you with the impression that you should have gotten more out of it than you did .
1134	choppy , overlong documentary about 'the lifestyle . '
1135	high on melodrama . but it's emotionally engrossing , too , thanks to strong , credible performances from the whole cast .
1136	like the film's almost anthropologically detailed realization of early-'80s suburbia , it's significant without being overstated .
1137	it's been made with an innocent yet fervid conviction that our hollywood has all but lost .
1138	norton holds the film together .
1139	it's no accident that the accidental spy is a solid action pic that returns the martial arts master to top form .
1140	much like robin williams , death to smoochy has already reached its expiration date .
1141	the drama discloses almost nothing .
1142	a plethora of engaging diatribes on the meaning of 'home , ' delivered in grand passion by the members of the various households .
1143	the visuals alone make metropolis worth seeing .
1144	bleakly funny , its characters all the more touching for refusing to pity or memorialize themselves .
1145	she's all-powerful , a voice for a pop-cyber culture that feeds on her bjorkness .
1146	ya-yas everywhere will forgive the flaws and love the film .
1147	a crude teen-oriented variation on a theme that the playwright craig lucas explored with infinitely more grace and eloquence in his prelude to a kiss .
1148	granddad of le nouvelle vague , jean-luc godard continues to baffle the faithful with his games of hide-and-seek .
1149	not only does spider-man deliver , but i suspect it might deliver again and again .
1150	gives everyone something to shout about .
1151	will grab your children by the imagination and amaze them and amuse them .
1152	just as the recent argentine film son of the bride reminded us that a feel-good movie can still show real heart , time of favor presents us with an action movie that actually has a brain .
1153	a modest pleasure that accomplishes its goals with ease and confidence .
1154	to show these characters in the act and give them no feelings of remorse -- and to cut repeatedly to the flashback of the original rape -- is overkill to the highest degree .
1155	the story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head .
1156	master of disguise runs for only 71 minutes and feels like three hours .
1157	the sad thing about knockaround guys is its lame aspiration for grasping the coolness vibes when in fact the film isn't as flippant or slick as it thinks it is .
1158	bubba ho-tep is a wonderful film with a bravura lead performance by bruce campbell that doesn't deserve to leave the building until everyone is aware of it .
1159	if this is satire , it's the smug and self-congratulatory kind that lets the audience completely off the hook .
1160	the corpse count ultimately overrides what little we learn along the way about vicarious redemption .
1161	the film is old-fashioned , occasionally charming and as subtle as boldface .
1162	a perfectly acceptable , perfectly bland , competently acted but by no means scary horror movie .
1163	the film has a few cute ideas and several modest chuckles but it isn't exactly kiddie-friendly… alas , santa is more ho-hum than ho-ho-ho and the snowman ( who never gets to play that flute ) has all the charm of a meltdown .
1164	guy gets girl , guy loses girl , audience falls asleep .
1165	behan's memoir is great material for a film -- rowdy , brawny and lyrical in the best irish sense -- but sheridan has settled for a lugubrious romance .
1166	when perry fists a bull at the moore farm , it's only a matter of time before he gets the upper hand in matters of the heart .
1167	wiseman is patient and uncompromising , letting his camera observe and record the lives of women torn apart by a legacy of abuse .
1168	. . . a good , if not entirely fresh , look at war .
1169	divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood may not be exactly divine , but it's definitely -- defiantly -- ya ya , what with all of those terrific songs and spirited performances .
1170	unfortunately , the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making .
1171	unintelligible , poorly acted , brain-slappingly bad , harvard man is ludicrous enough that it could become a cult classic .
1172	smith's point is simple and obvious -- people's homes are extensions of themselves , and particularly eccentric people have particularly eccentric living spaces -- but his subjects are charmers .
1173	a tired , unnecessary retread . . . a stale copy of a picture that wasn't all that great to begin with .
1174	by halfway through this picture i was beginning to hate it , and , of course , feeling guilty for it . . . . then , miracle of miracles , the movie does a flip-flop .
1175	ice cube isn't quite out of ripe screwball ideas , but friday after next spreads them pretty thin .
1176	examines its explosive subject matter as nonjudgmentally as wiseman's previous studies of inner-city high schools , hospitals , courts and welfare centers .
1177	it's predictable , but it jumps through the expected hoops with style and even some depth .
1178	will anyone who isn't a fangoria subscriber be excited that it hasn't gone straight to video ?
1179	is not so much a work of entertainment as it is a unique , well-crafted psychological study of grief .
1180	if you enjoy more thoughtful comedies with interesting conflicted characters ; this one is for you .
1181	just as the lousy tarantino imitations have subsided , here comes the first lousy guy ritchie imitation .
1182	thanks to ice cube , benjamins feels an awful lot like friday in miami .
1183	this quiet , introspective and entertaining independent is worth seeking .
1184	a selection of scenes in search of a movie .
1185	es divertida , visualmente espectacular y muy entretenida . simple y sencillamente te sorprenderá .
1186	human nature initially succeeds by allowing itself to go crazy , but ultimately fails by spinning out of control .
1187	you will likely prefer to keep on watching .
1188	a mechanical action-comedy whose seeming purpose is to market the charismatic jackie chan to even younger audiences .
1189	not only is it hokey , manipulative and as bland as wonder bread dipped in milk , but it also does the absolute last thing we need hollywood doing to us : it preaches .
1190	raimi and his team couldn't have done any better in bringing the story of spider-man to the big screen .
1191	don't even bother to rent this on video .
1192	its vision of that awkward age when sex threatens to overwhelm everything else is acute enough to make everyone who has been there squirm with recognition .
1193	all in all , there's only one thing to root for : expulsion for everyone .
1194	while this gentle and affecting melodrama will have luvvies in raptures , it's far too slight and introspective to appeal to anything wider than a niche audience .
1195	children , christian or otherwise , deserve to hear the full story of jonah's despair -- in all its agonizing , catch-22 glory -- even if they spend years trying to comprehend it .
1196	ramsay succeeds primarily with her typical blend of unsettling atmospherics , delivering a series of abrasive , stylized sequences that burn themselves upon the viewer's memory .
1197	some movies can get by without being funny simply by structuring the scenes as if they were jokes : a setup , delivery and payoff . stealing harvard can't even do that much . each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth .
1198	in the name of an allegedly inspiring and easily marketable flick , the emperor's club turns a blind eye to the very history it pretends to teach .
1199	none of this sounds promising and , indeed , the first half of sorority boys is as appalling as any 'comedy' to ever spill from a projector's lens .
1200	you can fire a torpedo through some of clancy's holes , and the scripters don't deserve any oscars . but the nerve-raked acting , the crackle of lines , the impressive stagings of hardware , make for some robust and scary entertainment .
1201	some movies were made for the big screen , some for the small screen , and some , like ballistic : ecks vs . sever , were made for the palm screen .
1202	maudlin and melodramatic we expected . boring we didn't .
1203	it would take a complete moron to foul up a screen adaptation of oscar wilde's classic satire .
1204	it's never a good sign when a film's star spends the entirety of the film in a coma . it's a worse sign when you begin to envy her condition .
1205	although some viewers will not be able to stomach so much tongue-in-cheek weirdness , those who do will have found a cult favorite to enjoy for a lifetime .
1206	is it a comedy ? a drama ? a romance ? a cartoon ?
1207	it doesn't do the original any particular dishonor , but neither does it exude any charm or personality .
1208	constantly touching , surprisingly funny , semi-surrealist exploration of the creative act .
1209	the combination of lightness and strictness in this instance gives italian for beginners an amiable aimlessness that keeps it from seeming predictably formulaic .
1210	any movie this boring should be required to have ushers in the theater that hand you a cup of coffee every few minutes . like a marathon runner trying to finish a race , you need a constant influx of liquid just to get through it .
1211	a fascinating but choppy documentary .
1212	while its careful pace and seemingly opaque story may not satisfy every moviegoer's appetite , the film's final scene is soaringly , transparently moving .
1213	together , tok and o orchestrate a buoyant , darkly funny dance of death . in the process , they demonstrate that there's still a lot of life in hong kong cinema .
1214	a disturbing examination of what appears to be the definition of a 'bad' police shooting .
1215	y tu mamá también es un buen filme gracias a lo poco convencional de su narrativa , y es quizá el proyecto más arriesgado en la carrera de alfonso cuarón
1216	for all its failed connections , divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood is nurturing , in a gauzy , dithering way .
1217	seagal , who looks more like danny aiello these days , mumbles his way through the movie .
1218	rosenthal ( halloween ii ) seems to have forgotten everything he ever knew about generating suspense .
1219	it wouldn't be my preferred way of spending 100 minutes or $7 . 00 .
1220	fessenden has nurtured his metaphors at the expense of his narrative , but he does display an original talent .
1221	intended to be a comedy about relationships , this wretched work falls flat in just about every conceivable area .
1222	huppert gives erika a persona that is so intriguing that you find yourself staring hypnotically at her , trying to understand her and wondering if she'll crack .
1223	apallingly absurd . . . the chemistry or lack thereof between newton and wahlberg could turn an imax theater into a 9 " black and white portable tv .
1224	an uplifting , largely bogus story .
1225	critics need a good laugh , too , and this too-extreme-for-tv rendition of the notorious mtv show delivers the outrageous , sickening , sidesplitting goods in steaming , visceral heaps .
1226	fathers and sons , and the uneasy bonds between them , rarely have received such a sophisticated and unsentimental treatment on the big screen as they do in this marvelous film .
1227	i kept thinking over and over again , 'i should be enjoying this . ' but i wasn't .
1228	a sharp and quick documentary that is funny and pithy , while illuminating an era of theatrical comedy that , while past , really isn't .
1229	it's good to see michael caine whipping out the dirty words and punching people in the stomach again .
1230	adults will certainly want to spend their time in the theater thinking up grocery lists and ways to tell their kids how not to act like pinocchio . as for children , they won't enjoy the movie at all .
1231	highly recommended viewing for its courage , ideas , technical proficiency and great acting .
1232	clooney directs this film always keeping the balance between the fantastic and the believable . . .
1233	does little more than play an innocuous game of fill-in- the-blanks with a tragic past .
1234	the action here is unusually tame , the characters are too simplistic to maintain interest , and the plot offers few surprises .
1235	no worse a film than breaking out , and breaking out was utterly charming .
1236	like the rugrats movies , the wild thornberrys movie doesn't offer much more than the series , but its emphasis on caring for animals and respecting other cultures is particularly welcome .
1237	the quirky drama touches the heart and the funnybone thanks to the energetic and always surprising performance by rachel griffiths .
1238	works as pretty contagious fun .
1239	solondz may be convinced that he has something significant to say , but he isn't talking a talk that appeals to me .
1240	there are a few laughs and clever sight gags scattered about , but not enough to make this anything more than another big-budget bust .
1241	me without you has a bracing truth that's refreshing after the phoniness of female-bonding pictures like divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood .
1242	this amiable picture talks tough , but it's all bluster -- in the end it's as sweet as greenfingers . . .
1243	britney has been delivered to the big screen safe and sound , the way we like our 20-year-old superstar girls to travel on the fame freeway .
1244	a prolonged extrusion of psychopathic pulp .
1245	son of the bride may be a good half-hour too long but comes replete with a flattering sense of mystery and quietness .
1246	for each chuckle there are at least 10 complete misses , many coming from the amazingly lifelike tara reid , whose acting skills are comparable to a cardboard cutout .
1247	the characters are based on stock clichés , and the attempt to complicate the story only defies credibility .
1248	a drama of great power , yet some members of the audience will leave the theater believing they have seen a comedy .
1249	distinctly sub-par . . . more likely to drown a viewer in boredom than to send any shivers down his spine .
1250	it may . . . work as a jaunt down memory lane for teens and young adults who grew up on televised scooby-doo shows or reruns .
1251	one minute , you think you're watching a serious actioner ; the next , it's as though clips from the pink panther strikes again and/or sailor moon have been spliced in .
1252	the obnoxious title character provides the drama that gives added clout to this doc .
1253	a very well-meaning movie , and it will stand in future years as an eloquent memorial to the world trade center tragedy .
1254	a subtle variation on i spit on your grave in which our purported heroine pathologically avenges a hatred for men .
1255	strictly a 'guy's film' in the worst sense of the expression .
1256	if you go into the theater expecting a scary , action-packed chiller , you might soon be looking for a sign . an exit sign , that is .
1257	if the movie were all comedy , it might work better . but it has an ambition to say something about its subjects , but not a willingness .
1258	one of the funniest motion pictures of the year , but . . . also one of the most curiously depressing .
1259	a slick , engrossing melodrama .
1260	contrived pastiche of caper clichés .
1261	family fare .
1262	the film is like sitting in a downtown café , overhearing a bunch of typical late-twenty-somethings natter on about nothing , and desperately wishing you could change tables .
1263	an experience so engrossing it is like being buried in a new environment .
1264	nervous breakdowns are not entertaining .

1273	dissing a bond movie is quite like calling a dog stupid , but when it has the temerity to run over two hours , you feel like winding up with a kick .
1274	even those who would like to dismiss the film outright should find much to mull and debate .

1278	depending upon your reaction to this movie , you may never again be able to look at a red felt sharpie pen without disgust , a thrill , or the giggles .
1279	a fragile framework upon which to hang broad , mildly fleshed-out characters that seem to have been conjured up only 10 minutes prior to filming .
1280	wasabi is slight fare indeed , with the entire project having the feel of something tossed off quickly ( like one of hubert's punches ) , but it should go down smoothly enough with popcorn .
1281	a thunderous ride at first , quiet cadences of pure finesse are few and far between ; their shortage dilutes the potency of otherwise respectable action . still , this flick is fun , and host to some truly excellent sequences .
1282	the drama was so uninspiring that even a story immersed in love , lust , and sin couldn't keep my attention .
1283	you really have to salute writer-director haneke ( he adapted elfriede jelinek's novel ) for making a film that isn't nearly as graphic but much more powerful , brutally shocking and difficult to watch .

1297	the exclamation point seems to be the only bit of glee you'll find in this dreary mess .
1298	for all of its insights into the dream world of teen life , and its electronic expression through cyber culture , the film gives no quarter to anyone seeking to pull a cohesive story out of its 2 1/2-hour running time .
1299	ice age is the first computer-generated feature cartoon to feel like other movies , and that makes for some glacial pacing early on .
1300	este é apenas mais um ( longo ) episódio do programa da mtv . a única diferença é que , desta vez , a paramount teve o mau gosto de exibi-lo nos cinemas .

1308	a sensitive and expertly acted crowd-pleaser that isn't above a little broad comedy and a few unabashedly sentimental tears .
1309	despite apparent motives to the contrary , it ends up being , like [seinfeld's] revered tv show , about pretty much nothing .
1310	the lower your expectations , the more you'll enjoy it .
1311	much of the movie's charm lies in the utter cuteness of stuart and margolo . their computer-animated faces are very expressive .
1312	. . . the kind of movie you see because the theater has air conditioning .
1313	how much you are moved by the emotional tumult of [françois and michèle's] relationship depends a lot on how interesting and likable you find them .
1314	trailer park magnolia : too long , too cutesy , too sure of its own importance , and possessed of that peculiar tension of being too dense & about nothing at all .
1315	when the movie mixes the cornpone and the cosa nostra , it finds a nice rhythm .
1316	needless to say , the dramatics that follow are utter hooey .
1317	let's face it -- there aren't many reasons anyone would want to see crossroads if they're not big fans of teen pop kitten britney spears .
1318	except for paymer as the boss who ultimately expresses empathy for bartleby's pain , the performances are so stylized as to be drained of human emotion .
1319	a waterlogged version of 'fatal attraction' for the teeny-bopper set . . . a sad , soggy potboiler that wastes the talents of its attractive young leads .
1320	if the very concept makes you nervous . . . you'll have an idea of the film's creepy , scary effectiveness .
1321	the movie's downfall is to substitute plot for personality . it doesn't really know or care about the characters , and uses them as markers for a series of preordained events .

1323	hard as this may be to believe , here on earth , a surprisingly similar teen drama , was a better film .
1324	this movie seems to have been written using mad-libs . there can be no other explanation . hilariously inept and ridiculous .
1325	director kapur is a filmmaker with a real flair for epic landscapes and adventure , and this is a better film than his earlier english-language movie , the overpraised elizabeth .
1326	it's the cute frissons of discovery and humor between chaplin and kidman that keep this nicely wound clock not just ticking , but humming .
1327	it's too self-important and plodding to be funny , and too clipped and abbreviated to be an epic .
1328	the film . . . presents classic moral-condundrum drama : what would you have done to survive ? the problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of auschwitz ii-birkenau .

1342	one of the most incoherent features in recent memory .
1343	a small independent film suffering from a severe case of hollywood-itis .

1345	absorbing character study by andré turpin .
1346	while the glass slipper doesn't quite fit , pumpkin is definitely a unique modern fairytale .
1347	smart , sassy interpretation of the oscar wilde play .
1348	it's hard to imagine anybody ever being " in the mood " to view a movie as harrowing and painful as the grey zone , but it's equally hard to imagine anybody being able to tear their eyes away from the screen once it's started .
1349	you could easily mistake it for a sketchy work-in-progress that was inexplicably rushed to the megaplexes before its time .
1350	you can thank me for this . i saw juwanna mann so you don't have to .
1351	scorsese doesn't give us a character worth giving a damn about .

1354	garcía bernal and talancón are an immensely appealing couple , and even though their story is predictable , you'll want things to work out .
1355	the most anti-human big studio picture since 3000 miles to graceland .
1356	attempts by this ensemble film to impart a message are so heavy-handed that they instead pummel the audience .
1357	it desperately wants to be a wacky , screwball comedy , but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time .
1358	drops you into a dizzying , volatile , pressure-cooker of a situation that quickly snowballs out of control , while focusing on the what much more than the why .
1359	what makes esther kahn so demanding is that it progresses in such a low-key manner that it risks monotony . but it's worth the concentration .
1360	at a brief 42 minutes , we need more x and less blab .
1361	one of these days hollywood will come up with an original idea for a teen movie , but until then there's always these rehashes to feed to the younger generations .
1362	there are cheesy backdrops , ridiculous action sequences , and many tired jokes about men in heels .
1363	why would anyone cast the magnificent jackie chan in a movie full of stunt doubles and special effects ?
1364	. . . rogers's mouth never stops shut about the war between the sexes and how to win the battle .
1365	a static and sugary little half-hour , after-school special about interfaith understanding , stretched out to 90 minutes .
1366	davis' candid , archly funny and deeply authentic take on intimate relationships comes to fruition in her sophomore effort .
1367	completely awful iranian drama . . . as much fun as a grouchy ayatollah in a cold mosque .
1368	although the level of the comedy declines as the movie proceeds , there's no denying the fun of watching de niro and crystal having fun .
1369	it's the kind of movie that ends up festooning u . s . art house screens for no reason other than the fact that it's in french ( well , mostly ) with english subtitles and is magically 'significant' because of that .
1370	only for young children , if them . their parents would do well to cram earplugs in their ears and put pillowcases over their heads for 87 minutes .
1371	late marriage's stiffness is unlikely to demonstrate the emotional clout to sweep u . s . viewers off their feet .
1372	jackie chan movies are a guilty pleasure - he's easy to like and always leaves us laughing .
1373	sandra nettelbeck beautifully orchestrates the transformation of the chilly , neurotic , and self-absorbed martha as her heart begins to open .
1374	unless bob crane is someone of particular interest to you , this film's impressive performances and adept direction aren't likely to leave a lasting impression .
1375	. . . a magnificent drama well worth tracking down .
1376	a dreadful live-action movie .
1377	a fan film that for the uninitiated plays better on video with the sound turned down .
1378	daughter from danang reveals that efforts toward closure only open new wounds . it doesn't flinch from its unsettling prognosis , namely , that the legacy of war is a kind of perpetual pain .

1385	true tale of courage -- and complicity -- at auschwitz is a harrowing drama that tries to tell of the unspeakable .
1386	o ótimo esforço do diretor acaba sendo frustrado pelo roteiro , que , depois de levar um bom tempo para colocar a trama em andamento , perde-se de vez a partir do instante em que os estranhos acontecimentos são explicados .
1387	the château would have been benefited from a sharper , cleaner script before it went in front of the camera . not to mention a sharper , cleaner camera lens .
1388	the master of disguise falls under the category of 'should have been a sketch on saturday night live . '
1389	this heist flick about young brooklyn hoods is off the shelf after two years to capitalize on the popularity of vin diesel , seth green and barry pepper . it should have stayed there .
1390	with a story inspired by the tumultuous surroundings of los angeles , where feelings of marginalization loom for every dreamer with a burst bubble , the dogwalker has a few characters and ideas , but it never manages to put them on the same path .
1391	as social exposé , skins has its heart in the right place , but that's not much to hang a soap opera on .
1392	the pairing does sound promising in theory . . . but their lack of chemistry makes eddie murphy and robert deniro in showtime look like old , familiar vaudeville partners .
1393	shows moments of promise but ultimately succumbs to cliches and pat storytelling .
1394	whether kiss is a future cult classic or destined to be completely forgotten is open to question , but the risk-takers in the crowd should check it out and form their own opinion .
1395	the mood , look and tone of the film fit the incredible storyline to a t .
1396	unfortunately , it appears that [jackie] chan's us influence is starting to show in his hong kong films .
1397	though it was made with careful attention to detail and is well-acted by james spader and maggie gyllenhaal , i felt disrespected .
1398	cry havoc and let slip the dogs of cheese , indeed .
1399	[næs] directed the stage version of elling , and gets fine performances from his two leads who originated the characters on stage .
1400	a gratingly unfunny groaner littered with zero-dimensional , unlikable characters and hackneyed , threadbare comic setups .
1401	like all of egoyan's work , ararat is fiercely intelligent and uncommonly ambitious .
1402	an awkwardly garish showcase that diverges from anything remotely probing or penetrating .
1403	never inspires more than an interested detachment .
1404	berling and béart . . . continue to impress , and isabelle huppert . . . again shows uncanny skill in getting under the skin of her characters .
1405	pacino and williams seem to keep upping the ante on each other , just as their characters do in the film . what results is the best performance from either in years .
1406	the film is like a series of beginnings and middles that never take off .
1407	the problem isn't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball .
1408	a markedly inactive film , city is conversational bordering on confessional .
1409	despite its sincere acting , signs is just another unoriginal run of the mill sci-fi film with a flimsy ending and lots of hype .
1410	rather less than the sum of its underventilated père-fils confrontations .
1411	nicholson's understated performance is wonderful . as warren he stumbles in search of all the emotions and life experiences he's neglected over the years .
1412	puts to rest any thought that the german film industry cannot make a delightful comedy centering on food .
1413	predecessors the mummy and the mummy returns stand as intellectual masterpieces next to the scorpion king .
1414	a moving and stark reminder that the casualties of war reach much further than we imagine .
1415	gets the look and the period trappings right , but it otherwise drowns in a sea of visual and verbal clichés .
1416	one long string of cliches .
1417	thoroughly engrossing and ultimately tragic .
1418	a comic gem with some serious sparkles .
1419	we've seen it all before in one form or another , but director hoffman , with great help from kevin kline , makes us care about this latest reincarnation of the world's greatest teacher .
1420	. . . unbearably lame .
1421	the sequel plays out like a flimsy excuse to give blade fans another look at wesley snipes' iconic hero doing battle with dozens of bad guys -- at once .
1422	there's no clear picture of who killed bob crane . but here's a glimpse at his life .
1423	one of the best films i have ever seen , constantly pulling the rug from underneath us , seeing things from new sides , plunging deeper , getting more intense .
1424	tells a fascinating , compelling story .
1425	in the spirit of the season , i assign one bright shining star to roberto benigni's pinocchio -- but i guarantee that no wise men will be following after it .
1426	what started out as a taut contest of wills between bacon and theron , deteriorates into a protracted and borderline silly chase sequence .
1427	it's a ripper of a yarn and i for one enjoyed the thrill of the chill . naomi watts is terrific as rachel ; her petite frame and vulnerable persona emphasising her plight and isolation .
1428	an enchanting spectacular for potter fans anxious to ride the hogwarts express toward a new year of magic and mischief .
1429	'almodóvar logra un filme entrañable , lleno de compasión , comprensión , amor , amistad , esperanza y humanidad que es sencillamente inolvidable . '
1430	ryosuke has created a wry , winning , if languidly paced , meditation on the meaning and value of family .
1431	the fascination comes in the power of the huston performance , which seems so larger than life and yet so fragile , and in the way the ivan character accepts the news of his illness so quickly but still finds himself unable to react .
1432	a good film with a solid pedigree both in front of and , more specifically , behind the camera .
1433	despite impeccable acting . . . and a script that takes some rather unexpected ( even , at times , preposterous ) turns , love is just too , too precious in the end .
1434	antwone fisher certainly does the trick of making us care about its protagonist and celebrate his victories but , with few exceptions , it rarely stoops to cheap manipulation or corny conventions to do it .
1435	rather than real figures , elling and kjell bjarne become symbolic characters whose actions are supposed to relate something about the naïf's encounter with the world .
1436	the result puts a human face on derrida , and makes one of the great minds of our times interesting and accessible to people who normally couldn't care less .
1437	wildly incompetent but brilliantly named half past dead -- or for seagal pessimists : totally past his prime .
1438	the viewer takes great pleasure in watching the resourceful molly stay a step ahead of her pursuers .
1439	no one can doubt the filmmakers' motives , but the guys still feels counterproductive .
1440	o Último suspeito ganha força ao também funcionar em uma esfera adicional : a do drama familiar .
1441	national lampoon's van wilder could be the worst thing to come out of national lampoon since class reunion
1442	was that movie nothing more than a tepid exercise in trotting out a formula that worked five years ago but has since lost its fizz ?
1443	it follows the blair witch formula for an hour , in which we're told something creepy and vague is in the works , and then it goes awry in the final 30 minutes .
1444	sometimes charming , sometimes infuriating , this argentinean 'dramedy' succeeds mainly on the shoulders of its actors .
1445	in its own floundering way , it gets to you . just like igby .
1446	it's a tour de force , written and directed so quietly that it's implosion rather than explosion you fear .
1447	a long-winded and stagy session of romantic contrivances that never really gels like the shrewd feminist fairy tale it could have been .
1448	works because , for the most part , it avoids the stupid cliches and formulaic potholes that befall its brethren .
1449	you don't have to know about music to appreciate the film's easygoing blend of comedy and romance .
1450	the film's bathos often overwhelms what could have been a more multifaceted look at this interesting time and place .
1451	graham greene's novel of colonialism and empire is elevated by michael caine's performance as a weary journalist in a changing world .
1452	while i can't say it's on par with the first one , stuart little 2 is a light , fun cheese puff of a movie .
1453	daring and beautifully made .
1454	renner ? s face is chillingly unemotive , yet he communicates a great deal in his performance . see it for his performance if nothing else .
1455	it works its magic with such exuberance and passion that the film's length becomes a part of its fun .
1456	subversive , meditative , clinical and poetic , the piano teacher is a daring work of genius .
1457	this off-putting french romantic comedy is sure to test severely the indulgence of fans of amélie .
1458	. . . there's enough cool fun here to warm the hearts of animation enthusiasts of all ages .
1459	the culmination of everyone's efforts is given life when a selection appears in its final form [in " last dance " ] .
1460	it's not just a feel-good movie , it's a feel movie . you feel good , you feel sad , you feel pissed off , but in the end , you feel alive - which is what they did .
1461	a powerful and telling story that examines forbidden love , racial tension , and other issues that are as valid today as they were in the 1950s .
1462	scott delivers a terrific performance in this fascinating portrait of a modern lothario .
1463	sweet home alabama " is what it is – a nice , harmless date film . . .
1464	the leaping story line , shaped by director peter kosminsky into sharp slivers and cutting impressions , shows all the signs of rich detail condensed into a few evocative images and striking character traits .
1465	see clockstoppers if you have nothing better to do with 94 minutes . but be warned , you too may feel time has decided to stand still . or that the battery on your watch has died .
1466	this film was made by and for those folks who collect the serial killer cards and are fascinated by the mere suggestion of serial killers . for the rest of us , sitting through dahmer's two hours amounts to little more than punishment .
1467	large budget notwithstanding , the movie is such a blip on the year's radar screen that it's tempting just to go with it for the ride . but this time , the old mib label stands for milder isn't better .
1468	. . . spiced with humor ( 'i speak fluent flatula , ' advises denlopp after a rather , er , bubbly exchange with an alien deckhand ) and witty updatings ( silver's parrot has been replaced with morph , a cute alien creature who mimics everyone and everything around )
1469	too daft by half . . . but supremely good natured .
1470	a party-hearty teen flick that scalds like acid .
1471	don't plan on the perfect ending , but sweet home alabama hits the mark with critics who escaped from a small town life .
1472	just one more collection of penis , breast and flatulence gags in search of a story . or a profit . or some damn thing .
1473	'opening up' the play more has partly closed it down .
1474	the filmmakers want nothing else than to show us a good time , and in their cheap , b movie way , they succeed .
1475	the narrator and the other characters try to convince us that acting transfigures esther , but she's never seen speaking on stage ; one feels cheated , and esther seems to remain an unchanged dullard .
1476	it's burns' visuals , characters and his punchy dialogue , not his plot , that carry waydowntown .
1477	a deliciously mordant , bitter black comedy .
1478	the predominantly amateur cast is painful to watch , so stilted and unconvincing are the performances .
1479	a lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud , violent and mindless .
1480	gorgeous scenes , masterful performances , but the sickly sweet gender normative narrative left an acrid test in this gourmet's mouth .
1481	undoubtedly the scariest movie ever made about tattoos .
1482	it has a subtle way of getting under your skin and sticking with you long after it's over .
1483	the film makes a strong case for the importance of the musicians in creating the motown sound .
1484	watstein handily directs and edits around his screenplay's sappier elements . . . and sustains off the hook's buildup with remarkable assuredness for a first-timer .
1485	sensitively examines general issues of race and justice among the poor , and specifically raises serious questions about the death penalty and asks what good the execution of a mentally challenged woman could possibly do .
1486	a movie you observe , rather than one you enter into .
1487	nonsensical , dull " cyber-horror " flick is a grim , hollow exercise in flat scares and bad acting .
1488	. . . an enjoyably frothy 'date movie' . . .
1489	the film often achieves a mesmerizing poetry .
1490	it was filled with shootings , beatings , and more cussing than you could shake a stick at .
1491	too leisurely paced and visually drab for its own good , it succeeds in being only sporadically amusing .
1492	check your brain and your secret agent decoder ring at the door because you don't want to think too much about what's going on . the movie does has some entertainment value - how much depends on how well you like chris rock .
1493	overall , interesting as a documentary -- but not very imaxy .
1494	sem se preocupar em criar momentos melodramáticos para arrancar lágrimas do espectador , o pianista é um filme triste sem que , para isso , precise ser emocionante .
1495	after the setup , the air leaks out of the movie , flattening its momentum with about an hour to go .
1496	murder by numbers just doesn't add up .
1497	this cinema verite speculation on the assassination of john f . kennedy may have been inspired by blair witch , but it takes its techniques into such fresh territory that the film never feels derivative .
1498	( rises ) above its oh-so-hollywood rejiggering and its conventional direction to give the film a soul and an unabashed sense of good old-fashioned escapism .
1499	an alternately raucous and sappy ethnic sitcom . . . you'd be wise to send your regrets .
1500	a collage of clichés and a dim echo of allusions to other films .
1501	good movie . good actress . but if you expect light romantic comedy , good gosh , will you be shocked .
1502	a period story about a catholic boy who tries to help a jewish friend get into heaven by sending the audience straight to hell .
1503	the directive to protect the code at all costs also begins to blur as the importance of the man and the code merge
1504	this new time machine is hardly perfect… yet it proves surprisingly serviceable . even at its worst , it's not half-bad .
1505	the story that emerges has elements of romance , tragedy and even silent-movie comedy .
1506	famuyiwa's feature deals with its subject matter in a tasteful , intelligent manner , rather than forcing us to endure every plot contrivance that the cliché-riddled genre can offer .
1507	at its worst , the movie is pretty diverting ; the pity is that it rarely achieves its best .
1508	the gorgeously elaborate continuation of " the lord of the rings " trilogy is so huge that a column of words cannot adequately describe co-writer/director peter jackson's expanded vision of j . r . r . tolkien's middle-earth .
1509	no worse than a lot of the crap we've been offered this summer , and slightly better than men in black 2 as far as slapdash extraterrestrial comedies go .
1510	not the best herzog perhaps , but unmistakably herzog .
1511	captures that perverse element of the kafkaesque where identity , overnight , is robbed and replaced with a persecuted " other . "
1512	informative , intriguing , observant , often touching . . . gives a human face to what's often discussed in purely abstract terms .
1513	those 24-and-unders looking for their own caddyshack to adopt as a generational signpost may have to keep on looking .
1514	. . . the film falls back on the same old formula of teen sex , outrageous pranks and scenes designed to push the envelope of bad taste for laughs .
1515	'de niro . . . is a veritable source of sincere passion that this hollywood contrivance orbits around . '
1516	hollywood ending just isn't very funny .
1517	schneider's mugging is relentless and his constant need to suddenly transpose himself into another character undermines the story's continuity and progression .
1518	the piece plays as well as it does thanks in large measure to anspaugh's three lead actresses .
1519	the notion of deleting emotion from people , even in an advanced prozac nation , is so insanely dysfunctional that the rampantly designed equilibrium becomes a concept doofus .
1520	together writer-director danny verete's three tales comprise a powerful and reasonably fulfilling gestalt .
1521	so stupid , so ill-conceived , so badly drawn , it created whole new levels of ugly .
1522	a competent , unpretentious entertainment destined to fill the after-school slot at shopping mall theaters across the country .
1523	pratfalls aside , barbershop gets its greatest play from the timeless spectacle of people really talking to each other .
1524	it jumps around with little logic or continuity , presenting backstage bytes of information that never amount to a satisfying complete picture of this particular , anciently demanding métier .
1525	the film didn't move me one way or the other , but it was an honest effort and if you want to see a flick about telemarketers this one will due .
1526	on a cutting room floor somewhere lies . . . footage that might have made no such thing a trenchant , ironic cultural satire instead of a frustrating misfire .
1527	the rollerball sequences feel sanitised and stagey .
1528	the only young people who possibly will enjoy it are infants . . . who might be distracted by the movie's quick movements and sounds .
1529	what makes salton sea surprisingly engrossing is that caruso takes an atypically hypnotic approach to a world that's often handled in fast-edit , hopped-up fashion .
1530	what makes it worth watching is quaid's performance .
1531	a delightful entree in the tradition of food movies .
1532	perhaps the best sports movie i've ever seen .
1533	shallow .
1534	i found myself more appreciative of what the director was trying to do than of what he had actually done .
1535	maintains your sympathy for this otherwise challenging soul by letting you share her one-room world for a while .
1536	nós gosta muito de as duas torres .
1537	like the world of his film , hartley created a monster but didn't know how to handle it .
1538	it kinda works and qualifies as cool at times , but is just too lame to work or be cool at others .
1539	as relationships shift , director robert j . siegel allows the characters to inhabit their world without cleaving to a narrative arc .
1540	it looks closely , insightfully at fragile , complex relationships .
1541	if you're like me , a sucker for a good old fashion romance and someone who shamelessly loves to eat , then mostly martha offers all the perfect ingredients to more than satisfy your appetite .
1542	woo has as much right to make a huge action sequence as any director , but how long will filmmakers copy the " saving private ryan " battle scenes before realizing steven spielberg got it right the first time ?
1543	is an arthritic attempt at directing by callie khouri . i had to look away - this was god awful .
1544	the kind of film that leaves you scratching your head in amazement over the fact that so many talented people could participate in such an ill-advised and poorly executed idea .
1545	[ramsay] visually transforms the dreary expanse of dead-end distaste the characters inhabit into a poem of art , music and metaphor .
1546	the film is way too full of itself ; it's stuffy and pretentious in a give-me-an-oscar kind of way .
1547	the vampire thriller blade ii starts off as a wild hoot and then sucks the blood out of its fun – toward the end , you can feel your veins cringing from the workout .
1548	grating and tedious .
1549	my thoughts were focused on the characters . that is a compliment to kuras and miller . if i had been thinking about the visual medium , they would have been doing something wrong .
1550	when a film is created solely because it's a marketable product , soulless and ugly movies like this are the result . let your silly childhood nostalgia slumber unmolested .
1551	writer-director stephen gaghan has made the near-fatal mistake of being what the english call 'too clever by half . '
1552	though intrepid in exploring an attraction that crosses sexual identity , ozpetek falls short in showing us antonia's true emotions . . . but at the very least , his secret life will leave you thinking .
1553	it just goes to show , an intelligent person isn't necessarily an admirable storyteller .
1554	most fish stories are a little peculiar , but this is one that should be thrown back in the river .
1555	a fairly by-the-books blend of action and romance with sprinklings of intentional and unintentional comedy .
1556	it has all the excitement of eating oatmeal .
1557	the whole thing comes off like a particularly amateurish episode of bewitched that takes place during spring break .
1558	not only a reminder of how they used to make movies , but also how they sometimes still can be made .
1559	a comedy that is warm , inviting , and surprising .
1560	it's a bad sign when you're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest .
1561	as well-acted and well-intentioned as all or nothing is , however , the film comes perilously close to being too bleak , too pessimistic and too unflinching for its own good .
1562	the writing is clever and the cast is appealing .
1563	an unencouraging threefold expansion on the former mtv series , accompanying the stunt-hungry dimwits in a random series of collected gags , pranks , pratfalls , dares , injuries , etc .
1564	brown's saga , like many before his , makes for snappy prose but a stumblebum of a movie .
1565	walsh can't quite negotiate the many inconsistencies in janice's behavior or compensate for them by sheer force of charm .
1566	it never quite makes it to the boiling point , but manages to sustain a good simmer for most of its running time .
1567	it's not helpful to listen to extremist name-calling , regardless of whether you think kissinger was a calculating fiend or just a slippery self-promoter .
1568	you won't like roger , but you will quickly recognize him . and that's a big part of why we go to the movies .
1569	vividly conveys the passion , creativity , and fearlessness of one of mexico's most colorful and controversial artists -- a captivating drama that will speak to the nonconformist in us all .
1570	talkiness isn't necessarily bad , but the dialogue frequently misses the mark .
1571	a lively and engaging examination of how similar obsessions can dominate a family .
1572	you . . . get a sense of good intentions derailed by a failure to seek and strike just the right tone .
1573	beautiful , cold , oddly colorful and just plain otherworldly , a freaky bit of art that's there to scare while we delight in the images .
1574	if mostly martha is mostly unsurprising , it's still a sweet , even delectable diversion .
1575	i have always appreciated a smartly written motion picture , and , whatever flaws igby goes down may possess , it is undeniably that .
1576	the people in abc africa are treated as docile , mostly wordless ethnographic extras .
1577	a coda in every sense , the pinochet case splits time between a minute-by-minute account of the british court's extradition chess game and the regime's talking-head survivors .
1578	cattaneo should have followed the runaway success of his first film , the full monty , with something different .
1579	smothered by its own solemnity .
1580	bolstered by an astonishing voice cast ( excepting love hewitt ) , an interesting racial tension , and a storyline that i haven't encountered since at least pete's dragon .
1581	enchanted with low-life tragedy and liberally seasoned with emotional outbursts . . . what is sorely missing , however , is the edge of wild , lunatic invention that we associate with cage's best acting .
1582	a good music documentary , probably one of the best since the last waltz .
1583	peralta's mythmaking could have used some informed , adult hindsight .
1584	at its best when the guarded , resentful betty and the manipulative yet needy margot are front and center .
1585	though jones and snipes are enthralling , the movie bogs down in rhetoric and cliché .
1586	'divertida , enternecedora , universal y profundamente sincera , es una de las mejores comedias románticas en mucho tiempo . una verdadera delicia . '
1587	a must-see for the david mamet enthusiast and for anyone who appreciates intelligent , stylish moviemaking .
1588	a quasi-documentary by french filmmaker karim dridi that celebrates the hardy spirit of cuban music .
1589	take care of my cat offers a refreshingly different slice of asian cinema .
1590	it must be the end of the world : the best film so far this year is a franchise sequel starring wesley snipes .
1591	what could have been right at home as a nifty plot line in steven soderbergh's traffic fails to arrive at any satisfying destination .
1592	it's impossible to indulge the fanciful daydreams of janice beard ( eileen walsh ) when her real-life persona is so charmless and vacant .
1593	this ill-fitting tuxedo is strictly off-the-rack .
1594	while certainly more naturalistic than its australian counterpart , amari's film falls short in building the drama of lilia's journey .
1595	it rapidly develops into a gut-wrenching examination of the way cultural differences and emotional expectations collide .
1596	" white oleander , " the movie , is akin to a reader's digest condensed version of the source material .
1597	some of their jokes work , but most fail miserably and in the end , pumpkin is far more offensive than it is funny .
1598	if jews were catholics , this would be catechism
1599	is it a total success ? no . is it something any true film addict will want to check out ? you bet .
1600	murder by numbers is like a couple of mediocre tv-movie -of-the-week films clumsily stuck together .
1601	impresses as a skillfully assembled , highly polished and professional adaptation . . . just about as chilling and unsettling as 'manhunter' was .
1602	it made me want to wrench my eyes out of my head and toss them at the screen .
1603	as original and insightful as last week's episode of behind the music .
1604	you wonder why enough wasn't just a music video rather than a full-length movie .
1605	instead of a witty expose on the banality and hypocrisy of too much kid-vid , we get an ugly , mean-spirited lashing out by an adult who's apparently been forced by his kids to watch too many barney videos .
1606	[a] stale retread of the '53 original .
1607	has a long and clunky ending . . . which forces the audience to fidget through ten pseudo-serious minutes while waiting for the ending credits and the deleted scenes montage to break the audience's awkward silence
1608	a fascinating glimpse into an insular world that gives the lie to many clichés and showcases a group of dedicated artists .
1609	our culture is headed down the toilet with the ferocity of a frozen burrito after an all-night tequila bender — and i know this because i've seen 'jackass : the movie . '
1610	great story , bad idea for a movie .
1611	the movie is so resolutely cobbled together out of older movies that it even uses a totally unnecessary prologue , just because it seems obligatory .
1612	the slapstick is labored , and the bigger setpieces flat .
1613	jones has tackled a meaty subject and drawn engaging characters while peppering the pages with memorable zingers .
1614	it's difficult to say whether the tuxedo is more boring or embarrassing--i'm prepared to call it a draw .
1615	fisher has bared his soul and confronted his own shortcomings here in a way . . . that feels very human and very true to life .
1616	the film is reasonably entertaining , though it begins to drag two-thirds through , when the melodramatic aspects start to overtake the comedy .
1617	a passable romantic comedy , in need of another couple of passes through the word processor .
1618	the subject of swinging still seems ripe for a documentary -- just not this one .
1619	stealing harvard aspires to comedic grand larceny but stands convicted of nothing more than petty theft of your time .
1620	the picture emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment .
1621	. . . too dull to enjoy .
1622	it's a rollicking adventure for you and all your mateys , regardless of their ages .
1623	naipaul fans may be disappointed . those who are not acquainted with the author's work , on the other hand , may fall fast asleep .
1624	much smarter and more attentive than it first sets out to be .
1625	an enjoyable feel-good family comedy regardless of race .
1626	ultimately , jane learns her place as a girl , softens up and loses some of the intensity that made her an interesting character to begin with .
1627	the am-radio soundtrack and game cast -- tierney and the inimitable walken especially -- keep this unusual comedy from choking on its own conceit .
1628	any film that doesn't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss .
1629	by turns numbingly dull-witted and disquietingly creepy .
1630	nair's cast is so large it's altman-esque , but she deftly spins the multiple stories in a vibrant and intoxicating fashion .
1631	. . . you can be forgiven for realizing that you've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for frida to just die already .
1632	in its dry and forceful way , it delivers the same message as jiri menzel's closely watched trains and danis tanovic's no man's land .
1633	a series of immaculately composed shots of patch adams quietly freaking out does not make for much of a movie .
1634	brian tufano's handsome widescreen photography and paul grabowsky's excellent music turn this fairly parochial melodrama into something really rather special .
1635	it's an old story , but a lively script , sharp acting and partially animated interludes make just a kiss seem minty fresh .
1636	i can't remember the last time i saw a movie where i wanted so badly for the protagonist to fail .
1637	the plot grows thin soon , and you find yourself praying for a quick resolution .
1638	in the end , the film is less the cheap thriller you'd expect than it is a fairly revealing study of its two main characters — damaged-goods people whose orbits will inevitably and dangerously collide .
1639	this version incarnates the prophetic book in a way even its exacting author might admire .
1640	singer/composer bryan adams contributes a slew of songs — a few potential hits , a few more simply intrusive to the story — but the whole package certainly captures the intended , er , spirit of the piece .
1641	the film has an infectious enthusiasm and we're touched by the film's conviction that all life centered on that place , that time and that sport .
1642	connoisseurs of chinese film will be pleased to discover that tian's meticulous talent has not withered during his enforced hiatus .
1643	coral reef adventure is a heavyweight film that fights a good fight on behalf of the world's endangered reefs -- and it lets the pictures do the punching .
1644	a gem of a movie .
1645	there's too much falseness to the second half , and what began as an intriguing look at youth fizzles into a dull , ridiculous attempt at heart-tugging .
1646	changing lanes is an anomaly for a hollywood movie ; it's a well-written and occasionally challenging social drama that actually has something interesting to say .
1647	this formulaic chiller will do little to boost stallone's career .
1648	the problem is that the movie has no idea of it is serious or not .
1649	it's hard to imagine another director ever making his wife look so bad in a major movie .
1650	going to the website may be just as fun ( and scary ) as going to the film .
1651	memorable for a peculiar malaise that renders its tension flaccid and , by extension , its surprises limp and its resolutions ritual .
1652	never again , while nothing special , is pleasant , diverting and modest -- definitely a step in the right direction .
1653	a free-for-all of half-baked thoughts , clumsily used visual tricks and self-indulgent actor moments .
1654	here's yet another studio horror franchise mucking up its storyline with glitches casual fans could correct in their sleep . but taken as a stylish and energetic one-shot , the queen of the damned cannot be said to suck .
1655	it's hard not to be seduced by [witherspoon's] charisma , even in this run-of-the-mill vehicle , because this girl knows how to drive it to the max .
1656	" antwone fisher " is an earnest , by-the-numbers effort by washington . it won't rock any boats but is solid meat-and-potatoes filmmaking .
1657	this film is too busy hitting all of its assigned marks to take on any life of its own .
1658	high drama , disney-style - a wing and a prayer and a hunky has-been pursuing his castle in the sky .
1659	collateral damage is , despite its alleged provocation post-9/11 , an antique , in the end . as are its star , its attitude and its obliviousness .
1660	it's a cool event for the whole family . maybe not a classic , but a movie the kids will want to see over and over again .
1661	the screenplay is hugely overwritten , with tons and tons of dialogue -- most of it given to children .
1662	flat , misguided comedy .
1663	one of the most slyly exquisite anti-adult movies ever made .
1664	we admire this film for its harsh objectivity and refusal to seek our tears , our sympathies .
1665	unfolds as one of the most politically audacious films of recent decades from any country , but especially from france .
1666	strange , funny , twisted , brilliant and macabre .
1667	an extremely unpleasant film .
1668	touché !
1669	delivers roughly equal amounts of beautiful movement and inside information .
1670	statham employs an accent that i think is supposed to be an attempt at hardass american but sometimes just lapses into unhidden british .
1671	uno de los policiales más interesantes de los últimos tiempos .
1672	hill looks to be going through the motions , beginning with the pale script .
1673	if no one singles out any of these performances as award-worthy , it's only because we would expect nothing less from this bunch .
1674	as chilling and fascinating as philippe mora's modern hitler-study , snide and prejudice .
1675	cold , pretentious , thoroughly dislikable study in sociopathy .
1676	holm does his sly , intricate magic , and iben hjelje is entirely appealing as pumpkin .
1677	i guess it just goes to show that if you give a filmmaker an unlimited amount of phony blood , nothing good can happen .
1678	the magic ( and original running time ) of ace japanimator hayao miyazaki's spirited away survives intact in bv's re-voiced version .
1679	an eccentric little comic/thriller deeply in love with its own quirky personality .
1680	. . . hokey art house pretension .
1681	a respectable but uninspired thriller that's intelligent and considered in its details , but ultimately weak in its impact .
1682	to some eyes this will seem like a recycling of clichés , an assassin's greatest hits . to others , it will remind them that hong kong action cinema is still alive and kicking .
1683	stephen earnhart's documentary is a decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition – wearing a cloak of unsentimental , straightforward text – when it's really an exercise in gross romanticization of the delusional personality type .
1684	cockettes has the glorious , gaudy benefit of much stock footage of those days , featuring all manner of drag queen , bearded lady and lactating hippie .
1685	this sort of cute and cloying material is far from zhang's forte and it shows .
1686	the skirmishes for power waged among victims and predators settle into an undistinguished rhythm of artificial suspense .
1687	the film might have been more satisfying if it had , in fact , been fleshed out a little more instead of going for easy smiles .
1688	why make a documentary about these marginal historical figures ? wouldn't one about their famous dad , author of death in venice , etc . , be more valuable ?
1689	a very stylish but ultimately extremely silly tale . . . a slick piece of nonsense but nothing more .
1690	the film provides some great insight into the neurotic mindset of all comics -- even those who have reached the absolute top of the game .
1691	an overstylized , puréed mélange of sex , psychology , drugs and philosophy . sometimes entertaining , sometimes indulgent -- but never less than pure wankery .
1692	the dragons are the real stars of reign of fire and you won't be disappointed .
1693	though there are many tense scenes in trapped , they prove more distressing than suspenseful .
1694	doesn't really add up to much .
1695	judith and zaza's extended bedroom sequence . . . is so intimate and sensual and funny and psychologically self-revealing that it makes most of what passes for sex in the movies look like cheap hysterics .
1696	girlfriends are bad , wives are worse and babies are the kiss of death in this bitter italian comedy .
1697	watching beanie and his gang put together his slasher video from spare parts and borrowed materials is as much fun as it must have been for them to make it .
1698	mild , meandering teen flick .
1699	" me without you " is a probing examination of a female friendship set against a few dynamic decades .
1700	there is simply no doubt that this film asks the right questions at the right time in the history of our country .
1701	it's as close as we'll ever come to looking through a photographer's viewfinder as he works .
1702	so relentlessly wholesome it made me want to swipe something .
1703	[t]his slop doesn't even have potential as a cult film , as it's too loud to shout insults at the screen .
1704	an endlessly fascinating , landmark movie that is as bold as anything the cinema has seen in years .
1705	an inelegant combination of two unrelated shorts that falls far short of the director's previous work in terms of both thematic content and narrative strength .
1706	after sitting through this sloppy , made-for-movie comedy special , it makes me wonder if lawrence hates criticism so much that he refuses to evaluate his own work .
1707	they ought to be a whole lot scarier than they are in this tepid genre offering .
1708	the slam-bang superheroics are kinetic enough to engross even the most antsy youngsters .
1709	martin scorsese cria um espetáculo visual que não possui alma - um filme esteticamente belo , mas emocionalmente frio .
1710	rich in atmosphere of the post-war art world , it manages to instruct without reeking of research library dust .
1711	this cloying , voices-from-the-other-side story is hell .
1712	if myers decides to make another austin powers movie , maybe he should just stick with austin and dr evil .
1713	a quiet , disquieting triumph .
1714	tully is worth a look for its true-to-life characters , its sensitive acting , its unadorned view of rural life and the subtle direction of first-timer hilary birmingham .
1715	the storylines are woven together skilfully , the magnificent swooping aerial shots are breathtaking , and the overall experience is awesome .
1716	the premise itself is just sooooo tired . pair that with really poor comedic writing . . . and you've got a huge mess .
1717	one regards reign of fire with awe . what a vast enterprise has been marshaled in the service of such a minute idea .
1718	a story which fails to rise above its disgusting source material .
1719	the funny thing is , i didn't mind all this contrived nonsense a bit .
1720	richly entertaining and suggestive of any number of metaphorical readings .
1721	follows the original film virtually scene for scene and yet manages to bleed it almost completely dry of humor , verve and fun .
1722	`hey arnold ! ' has some visual wit . . . but little imagination elsewhere .
1723	sum " is jack ryan's " do-over . " give credit to everyone from robinson down to the key grip that this bold move works . especially give credit to affleck .
1724	the continued good chemistry between carmen and juni is what keeps this slightly disappointing sequel going , with enough amusing banter -- blessedly curse-free -- to keep both kids and parents entertained .
1725	the only entertainment you'll derive from this choppy and sloppy affair will be from unintentional giggles – several of them .
1726	those moviegoers who would automatically bypass a hip-hop documentary should give " scratch " a second look .
1727	achieves a sort of filmic epiphany that revels in the true potential of the medium .
1728	the film sounds like the stuff of lurid melodrama , but what makes it interesting as a character study is the fact that the story is told from paul's perspective .
1729	the premise for this kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant four six-packs and a pitcher of margaritas in , but the film must have been written . . . in the thrall of a vicious hangover .
1730	an absorbing , slice-of-depression life that touches nerves and rings true .
1731	when your leading ladies are a couple of screen-eating dominatrixes like goldie hawn and susan sarandon at their raunchy best , even hokum goes down easily .
1732	confuses its message with an ultimate desire to please , and contorting itself into an idea of expectation is the last thing any of these three actresses , nor their characters , deserve .
1733	will probably be one of those movies barely registering a blip on the radar screen of 2002 .
1734	not even steven spielberg has dreamed up such blatant and sickening product placement in a movie .
1735	even during the climactic hourlong cricket match , boredom never takes hold .
1736	made me unintentionally famous — as the queasy-stomached critic who staggered from the theater and blacked out in the lobby . but believe it or not , it's one of the most beautiful , evocative works i've seen .
1737	en sí mismo el rey león es un espectáculo digno de contemplarse en cine , dvd o en su soberbio montaje teatral ; pero el hacerlo en la pantalla imax es una experiencia colosal .
1738	a gushy episode of " m * a * s * h " only this time from an asian perspective .
1739	plays like a glossy melodrama that occasionally verges on camp .
1740	meticulously uncovers a trail of outrageous force and craven concealment .
1741	a combination of standard , stiff tv-style animation and snazzy-looking digital effects that do little to disguise the fact that the characters barely move .
1742	. . . in the pile of useless actioners from mtv schmucks who don't know how to tell a story for more than four minutes .
1743	will assuredly rank as one of the cleverest , most deceptively amusing comedies of the year .
1744	scorsese at his best makes gangster films that are equally lovely but also relentlessly brutal and brutally intelligent ; perdition , meanwhile , reads more like driving miss daisy than goodfellas .
1745	authentic , and at times endearing , humorous , spooky , educational , but at other times as bland as a block of snow .
1746	this one is not nearly as dreadful as expected . in fact , it's quite fun in places .
1747	personal velocity has a no-frills docu-dogma plainness , yet miller lingers on invisible , nearly psychic nuances , leaping into digressions of memory and desire . she boxes these women's souls right open for us .
1748	a fake street drama that keeps telling you things instead of showing them .
1749	it's one thing to read about or rail against the ongoing - and unprecedented - construction project going on over our heads . it's quite another to feel physically caught up in the process .
1750	parts seem like they were lifted from terry gilliam's subconscious , pressed through kafka's meat grinder and into buñuel's casings
1751	lacks depth .
1752	a puppy dog so desperate for attention it nearly breaks its little neck trying to perform entertaining tricks .
1753	the director , with his fake backdrops and stately pacing , never settles on a consistent tone .
1754	la de salma es una versión de frida superficial , preciosista y sin ningún contenido .
1755	alan and his fellow survivors are idiosyncratic enough to lift the movie above its playwriting 101 premise .
1756	rodriguez . . . was unable to reproduce the special spark between the characters that made the first film such a delight .
1757	you may think you have figured out the con and the players in this debut film by argentine director fabian bielinsky , but while you were thinking someone made off with your wallet .
1758	as home movie gone haywire , it's pretty enjoyable , but as sexual manifesto , i'd rather listen to old tori amos records .
1759	it's hard to understand why anyone in his right mind would even think to make the attraction a movie . and it's harder still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it .
1760	. . . has about 3/4th the fun of its spry 2001 predecessor — but it's a rushed , slapdash , sequel-for-the-sake- of-a-sequel with less than half the plot and ingenuity .
1761	this idea has lost its originality . . . and neither star appears very excited at rehashing what was basically a one-joke picture .
1762	i highly recommend irwin , but not in the way this film showcases him .
1763	an entertaining documentary that freshly considers arguments the bard's immortal plays were written by somebody else .
1764	attal pushes too hard to make this a comedy or serious drama . he seems to want both , but succeeds in making neither .
1765	cold , nervy and memorable .
1766	awkward but sincere and , ultimately , it wins you over .
1767	sadly , though many of the actors throw off a spark or two when they first appear , they can't generate enough heat in this cold vacuum of a comedy to start a reaction .
1768	it strikes hardest… when it reminds you how pertinent its dynamics remain . fifty years after the fact , the world's political situation seems little different , and [director phillip] noyce brings out the allegory with remarkable skill .
1769	nothing short of a masterpiece -- and a challenging one .
1770	the story itself it mostly told through on-camera interviews with several survivors , whose riveting memories are rendered with such clarity that it's as if it all happened only yesterday .
1771	has none of the crackle of " fatal attraction " , " 9 ½ weeks " , or even " indecent proposal " , and feels more like lyne's stolid remake of " lolita " .
1772	sly , sophisticated and surprising .
1773	a frustrating yet deeply watchable melodrama that makes you think it's a tougher picture than it is .
1774	as they used to say in the 1950s sci-fi movies , signs is a tribute to shyamalan's gifts , which are such that we'll keep watching the skies for his next project .
1775	with three excellent principal singers , a youthful and good-looking diva and tenor and richly handsome locations , it's enough to make you wish jacquot had left well enough alone and just filmed the opera without all these distortions of perspective .
1776	becomes a fascinating study of isolation and frustration that successfully recreates both the physical setting and emotional tensions of the papin sisters .
1777	showtime isn't particularly assaultive , but it can still make you feel that you never want to see another car chase , explosion or gunfight again .
1778	this illuminating documentary transcends our preconceived vision of the holy land and its inhabitants , revealing the human complexities beneath .
1779	the picture is a primer on what happens when lack of know-how mixes with lack of give-a-damn .
1780	the movie's progression into rambling incoherence gives new meaning to the phrase 'fatal script error . '
1781	an engaging criminal romp that will have viewers guessing just who's being conned right up to the finale .
1782	perfectly enjoyable , instantly forgettable , nothing to write home about .
1783	barney has created a tour de force that is weird , wacky and wonderful .
1784	after the first 10 minutes , which is worth seeing , the movie sinks into an abyss of clichés , depression and bad alternative music .
1785	[it's] difficult to get beyond the overall blandness of american chai , despite its likable performances and refreshingly naive point of view .
1786	it's no surprise that as a director washington demands and receives excellent performances , from himself and from newcomer derek luke .
1787	perhaps the most annoying thing about who is cletis tout ? is that it's a crime movie made by someone who obviously knows nothing about crime .
1788	don't hate el crimen del padre amaro because it's anti-catholic . hate it because it's lousy .
1789	it's not original , and , robbed of the element of surprise , it doesn't have any huge laughs in its story of irresponsible cops who love to play pranks .
1790	is there enough material to merit a documentary on the making of wilco's last album ?
1791	mediocre fable from burkina faso .
1792	it's splash without the jokes .
1793	this film , starring anthony hopkins and chris rock , is your typical 'fish out of water' story . you've seen them a million times . just one problem : fish out of water usually die . this one does .
1794	the quality of the art combined with the humor and intelligence of the script allow the filmmakers to present the biblical message of forgiveness without it ever becoming preachy or syrupy .
1795	de oliveira creates an emotionally rich , poetically plump and visually fulsome , but never showy , film whose bittersweet themes are reinforced and brilliantly personified by michel piccoli .
1796	mattei's underdeveloped effort here is nothing but a convenient conveyor belt of brooding personalities that parade about as if they were coming back from stock character camp -- a drowsy drama infatuated by its own pretentious self-examination .
1797	most new movies have a bright sheen . some , like ballistic , arrive stillborn . . . looking like the beaten , well-worn video box cover of seven years into the future .
1798	decent but dull .
1799	as tricky and satisfying as any of david mamet's airless cinematic shell games .
1800	unlike his directorial efforts , la femme nikita and the professional , the transporter lacks besson's perspective as a storyteller .
1801	a dull , dumb and derivative horror film .
1802	a small movie with a big heart .
1803	if this is an example of the type of project that robert redford's lab is willing to lend its imprimatur to , then perhaps it's time to rethink independent films .
1804	gaunt , silver-haired and leonine , [harris] brings a tragic dimension and savage full-bodied wit and cunning to the aging sandeman .
1805	a prison comedy that never really busts out of its comfy little cell .
1806	as pedestrian as they come .
1807	the komediant is a tale worth catching .
1808	reign of fire is hardly the most original fantasy film ever made -- beyond road warrior , it owes enormous debts to aliens and every previous dragon drama -- but that barely makes it any less entertaining .
1809	es una de esas películas de las que uno sale reconfortado , agradecido , genuinamente sorprendido .
1810	like the excruciating end of days , collateral damage presents schwarzenegger as a tragic figure , but sympathy really belongs with any viewer forced to watch him try out so many complicated facial expressions .
1811	a thoughtful look at a painful incident that made headlines in 1995 .
1812	not since freddy got fingered has a major release been so painful to sit through .
1813	as an actor's showcase , hart's war has much to recommend it , even if the top-billed willis is not the most impressive player . as a story of dramatic enlightenment , the screenplay by billy ray and terry george leaves something to be desired .
1814	a literate presentation that wonderfully weaves a murderous event in 1873 with murderous rage in 2002 .
1815	unsurprisingly , the way this all works out makes the women look more like stereotypical caretakers and moral teachers , instead of serious athletes .
1816	plays like john le carré with a couple of burnt-out cylinders .
1817	don michael paul uses quick-cuts , ( very ) large shadows and wide-angle shots taken from a distance to hide the liberal use of a body double ( for seagal ) .
1818	despite its visual virtuosity , 'naqoyqatsi' is banal in its message and the choice of material to convey it .
1819	'estupendamente actuada , sumamente emotiva y profundamente humana , es una experiencia fílmica imposible de olvidar'
1820	automatically pegs itself for the straight-to-video sci-fi rental shelf .
1821	the character of zigzag is not sufficiently developed to support a film constructed around him .
1822	is " ballistic " worth the price of admission ? absolutely not . it sucked . would i see it again ? please see previous answer .
1823	it's mired in a shabby script that piles layer upon layer of action man cliché atop wooden dialogue and a shifting tone that falls far short of the peculiarly moral amorality of [woo's] best work .
1824	. . . planos fijos , tomas largas , un ritmo pausado y una sutil observación de sus personajes , sin estridencias ni grandes revelaciones .
1825	whether [binoche and magimel] are being charming or angst-ridden , they easily fill their scenes and , fine judges both , never overcook the hysteria .
1826	a seriously bad film with seriously warped logic by writer-director kurt wimmer at the screenplay level .
1827	münch's genuine insight makes the film's occasional overindulgence forgivable .
1828	an unremittingly ugly movie to look at , listen to , and think about , it is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the dv revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film .
1829	this movie is so bad , that it's almost worth seeing because it's so bad .
1830	it excels because , unlike so many other hollywood movies of its ilk , it offers hope .
1831	a mess , but it's a sincere mess .
1832	while this has the making of melodrama , the filmmaker cuts against this natural grain , producing a work that's more interested in asking questions than in answering them .
1833	i am more offended by his lack of faith in his audience than by anything on display here .
1834	eight legged freaks ? no big hairy deal .
1835	worth watching for dong jie's performance -- and for the way it documents a culture in the throes of rapid change .
1836	merchant effectively translates naipaul's lively mix of characters from the page to screen .
1837	if you are an actor who can relate to the search for inner peace by dramatically depicting the lives of others onstage , then esther's story is a compelling quest for truth .
1838	the movie is as far as you can get from racy , to the point where it almost stops the blood flow to your brain ; it has a dull , costumey feel .
1839	the movie ultimately relies a bit too heavily on grandstanding , emotional , rocky-like moments . . . but it's such a warm and charming package that you'll feel too happy to argue much .
1840	a rich tale of our times , very well told with an appropriate minimum of means .
1841	a tremendous piece of work .
1842	a gob of drivel so sickly sweet , even the eager consumers of moore's pasteurized ditties will retch it up like rancid crème brûlée .
1843	the entire movie has a truncated feeling , but what's available is lovely and lovable .
1844	long before it's over , you'll be thinking of 51 ways to leave this loser .
1845	sharp , lively , funny and ultimately sobering film .
1846	it's a work by an artist so in control of both his medium and his message that he can improvise like a jazzman .
1847	[ferrera] has the charisma of a young woman who knows how to hold the screen .
1848	for all its visual panache and compelling supporting characters , the heart of the film rests in the relationship between sullivan and his son .
1849	. . . salaciously simplistic .
1850	it's the sweet cinderella story that " pretty woman " wanted to be .
1851	outer-space buffs might love this film , but others will find its pleasures intermittent .
1852	with its paint fights , motorized scooter chases and dewy-eyed sentiment , it's a pretty listless collection of kid-movie clichés .
1853	'es en verdad una pena que mandoki esté realizando cintas tan malas desde hace algún tiempo , pues talento tiene , pero quién sabe dónde lo tiene escondido . '
1854	able to provide insight into a fascinating part of theater history .
1855	there is nothing redeeming about this movie .
1856	the simplicity of the way home has few equals this side of aesop
1857	you won't have any trouble getting kids to eat up these veggies .
1858	this is cruel , misanthropic stuff with only weak claims to surrealism and black comedy .
1859	dull , lifeless , and amateurishly assembled .
1860	liotta put on 30 pounds for the role , and has completely transformed himself from his smooth , goodfellas image .
1861	should have been someone else-
1862	true to its animatronic roots : . . . as stiff , ponderous and charmless as a mechanical apparatus . . . 'the country bears' should never have been brought out of hibernation .
1863	you get the impression that writer and director burr steers knows the territory . . . but his sense of humor has yet to lose the smug self-satisfaction usually associated with the better private schools .
1864	an eerily suspenseful , deeply absorbing piece that works as a treatise on spirituality as well as a solid sci-fi thriller .
1865	a movie that sends you out of the theater feeling like you've actually spent time living in another community .
1866	rice is too pedestrian a filmmaker to bring any edge or personality to the rising place that would set it apart from other deep south stories .
1867	among the many pleasures are the lively intelligence of the artists and their perceptiveness about their own situations .
1868	with nary a glimmer of self-knowledge , [crane] becomes more specimen than character -- and auto focus remains a chilly , clinical lab report .
1869	sits uneasily as a horror picture . . . but finds surprising depth in its look at the binds of a small family .
1870	a smart , sweet and playful romantic comedy .
1871	proof that a thriller can be sleekly shot , expertly cast , paced with crisp professionalism . . . and still be a letdown if its twists and turns hold no more surprise than yesterday's weather report .
1872	van wilder brings a whole new meaning to the phrase 'comedy gag . ' at least one scene is so disgusting that viewers may be hard pressed to retain their lunch .
1873	spare but quietly effective retelling .
1874	the second chapter of the harry potter series is even more magical than the first and simply the best family film of the year .
1875	lauren ambrose comes alive under the attention from two strangers in town - with honest performances and realistic interaction between the characters , this is a coming-of-age story with a twist .
1876	jones has delivered a solidly entertaining and moving family drama .
1877	ub equally spoofs and celebrates the more outre aspects of 'black culture' and the dorkier aspects of 'white culture , ' even as it points out how inseparable the two are .
1878	lacks heart , depth and , most of all , purpose .
1879	[t]he film is never sure to make a clear point – even if it seeks to rely on an ambiguous presentation .
1880	writer/ director m . night shyamalan's ability to pull together easily accessible stories that resonate with profundity is undeniable .
1881	murder by numbers' isn't a great movie , but it's a perfectly acceptable widget .
1882	there's no emotional pulse to solaris . with an emotional sterility to match its outer space setting , soderbergh's spectacular swing for the fence yields only a spectacular whiff .
1883	a droll , bitchy frolic which pokes fun at the price of popularity and small-town pretension in the lone star state .
1884	spectators will indeed sit open-mouthed before the screen , not screaming but yawning .
1885	happy times maintains an appealing veneer without becoming too cute about it .
1886	90 punitive minutes of eardrum-dicing gunplay , screeching-metal smashups , and flaccid odd-couple sniping .
1887	like its bizarre heroine , it irrigates our souls .
1888	historical dramas fused with love triangle is a well worn conceit . but this films lacks the passion required to sell the material .
1889	if the plot seems a bit on the skinny side , that's because panic room is interested in nothing more than sucking you in…and making you sweat .
1890	to work , love stories require the full emotional involvement and support of a viewer . that is made almost impossible by events that set the plot in motion .
1891	little more than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point . . . is no doubt true , but serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable .
1892	a moving and not infrequently breathtaking film .
1893	like rudy yellow lodge , eyre needs to take a good sweat to clarify his cinematic vision before his next creation and remember the lessons of the trickster spider .
1894	if ever a concept came handed down from the movie gods on a silver platter , this is it . if ever such a dependable concept was botched in execution , this is it .
1895	boisterous and daft documentary .
1896	a penetrating , potent exploration of sanctimony , self-awareness , self-hatred and self-determination .
1897	though moonlight mile is replete with acclaimed actors and actresses and tackles a subject that's potentially moving , the movie is too predictable and too self-conscious to reach a level of high drama .
1898	it understands , in a way that speaks forcefully enough about the mechanisms of poverty to transcend the rather simplistic filmmaking .
1899	the makers of divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood should offer a free ticket ( second prize , of course , two free tickets ) to anyone who can locate a genuinely honest moment in their movie .
1900	comes across as a fairly weak retooling .
1901	it's not particularly subtle . . . however , it still manages to build to a terrifying , if obvious , conclusion .
1902	thanks to haynes' absolute control of the film's mood , and buoyed by three terrific performances , far from heaven actually pulls off this stylistic juggling act .
1903	a visually flashy but narratively opaque and emotionally vapid exercise in style and mystification .
1904	spirit is a visual treat , and it takes chances that are bold by studio standards , but it lacks a strong narrative .
1905	the heat of the moment prevails . it cooks conduct in a low , smoky and inviting sizzle .
1906	the director , mark pellington , does a terrific job conjuring up a sinister , menacing atmosphere though unfortunately all the story gives us is flashing red lights , a rattling noise , and a bump on the head .
1907	a hard look at one man's occupational angst and its subsequent reinvention , a terrifying study of bourgeois desperation worthy of claude chabrol .
1908	more than simply a portrait of early extreme sports , this peek into the 1970s skateboard revolution is a skateboard film as social anthropology . . .
1909	a movie that harps on media-constructed 'issues' like whether compromise is the death of self… this orgasm [won't be an] exceedingly memorable one for most people .
1910	bogdanich is unashamedly pro-serbian and makes little attempt to give voice to the other side .
1911	blade ii is as estrogen-free as movies get , so you might want to leave your date behind for this one , or she's gonna make you feel like you owe her big-time .
1912	. . . a rather bland affair .
1913	a gripping drama .
1914	it would work much better as a one-hour tv documentary .
1915	beautifully filmed and well acted . . . but admittedly problematic in its narrative specifics .
1916	thriller directorial debut for traffic scribe gaghan has all the right parts , but the pieces don't quite fit together .
1917	it's definitely not made for kids or their parents , for that matter , and i think even fans of sandler's comic taste may find it uninteresting .
1918	more good than great but freeman and judd make it work .
1919	shot largely in small rooms , the film has a gentle , unforced intimacy that never becomes claustrophobic .
1920	a pretentious mess .
1921	makes even the claustrophobic on-board quarters seem fun .
1922	not since ghostbusters has a film used manhattan's architecture in such a gloriously goofy way .
1923	stephen rea , aidan quinn , and alan bates play desmond's legal eagles , and when joined by brosnan , the sight of this grandiloquent quartet lolling in pretty irish settings is a pleasant enough thing , 'tis .
1924	el título no engaña : la película narra una historia donde una mujer enfrentará cierta realidad , y donde el sexo es . . .
1925	below is well below expectations .
1926	verbinski substitutes atmosphere for action , tedium for thrills .
1927	. . . the whole thing succeeded only in making me groggy .
1928	ryan gosling is , in a word , brilliant as the conflicted daniel .
1929	the setting turns out to be more interesting than any of the character dramas , which never reach satisfying conclusions .
1930	for those in search of something different , wendigo is a genuinely bone-chilling tale .
1931	ms . hutchins is talented enough and charismatic enough to make us care about zelda's ultimate fate .
1932	the film itself is about something very interesting and odd that would probably work better as a real documentary without the insinuation of mediocre acting or a fairly trite narrative .
1933	topics that could make a sailor blush - but lots of laughs .
1934	a real audience-pleaser that will strike a chord with anyone who's ever waited in a doctor's office , emergency room , hospital bed or insurance company office .
1935	typical animé , with cheapo animation ( like saturday morning tv in the '60s ) , a complex sword-and-sorcery plot and characters who all have big round eyes and japanese names .
1936	for those for whom the name woody allen was once a guarantee of something fresh , sometimes funny , and usually genuinely worthwhile , hollywood ending is a depressing experience
1937	this is a fascinating film because there is no clear-cut hero and no all-out villain .
1938	if the film's vision of sport as a secular religion is a bit cloying , its through-line of family and community is heartening in the same way that each season marks a new start .
1939	although frailty fits into a classic genre , in its script and execution it is a remarkably original work .
1940	a sobering and powerful documentary about the most severe kind of personal loss : rejection by one's mother .
1941	well-written , nicely acted and beautifully shot and scored , the film works on several levels , openly questioning social mores while ensnaring the audience with its emotional pull .
1942	an amalgam of the fugitive , blade runner , and total recall , only without much energy or tension .
1943	the most memorable moment was when green threw medical equipment at a window ; not because it was particularly funny , but because i had a serious urge to grab the old lady at the end of my aisle's walker and toss it at the screen in frustration .
1944	thanks to the château's balance of whimsicality , narrative discipline and serious improvisation , almost every relationship and personality in the film yields surprises .
1945	there are flaws , but also stretches of impact and moments of awe ; we're wrapped up in the characters , how they make their choices , and why .
1946	it's a demented kitsch mess ( although the smeary digital video does match the muddled narrative ) , but it's savvy about celebrity and has more guts and energy than much of what will open this year .
1947	imagine o . henry's <b>the gift of the magi</b> relocated to the scuzzy underbelly of nyc's drug scene . merry friggin' christmas !
1948	the film has the thrown-together feel of a summer-camp talent show : hastily written , underrehearsed , arbitrarily plotted and filled with crude humor and vulgar innuendo .
1949	a charming yet poignant tale of the irrevocable ties that bind .
1950	symbolically , warm water under a red bridge is a celebration of feminine energy , a tribute to the power of women to heal .
1951	intensely romantic , thought-provoking and even an engaging mystery .
1952	high crimes miscasts nearly every leading character .
1953	mama africa pretty much delivers on that promise . it does give you a peek . the main problem being that it's only a peek .
1954	it is definitely worth seeing .
1955	the kind of sense of humor that derives from a workman's grasp of pun and entendre and its attendant need to constantly draw attention to itself .
1956	beneath the uncanny , inevitable and seemingly shrewd facade of movie-biz farce . . . lies a plot cobbled together from largely flat and uncreative moments .
1957	alternative medicine obviously has its merits . . . but ayurveda does the field no favors .
1958	it's inoffensive , cheerful , built to inspire the young people , set to an unending soundtrack of beach party pop numbers and aside from its remarkable camerawork and awesome scenery , it's about as exciting as a sunburn .
1959	if it's unnerving suspense you're after -- you'll find it with ring , an indisputably spooky film ; with a screenplay to die for .
1960	this is a film about the irksome , tiresome nature of complacency that remains utterly satisfied to remain the same throughout . even as the hero of the story rediscovers his passion in life , the mood remains oddly detached .
1961	although barbershop boasts some of today's hottest and hippest acts from the world of television , music and stand-up comedy , this movie strangely enough has the outdated swagger of a shameless ‘70s blaxploitation shuck-and-jive sitcom .
1962	much of all about lily chou-chou is mesmerizing : some of its plaintiveness could make you weep .
1963	una película oscura , precisa , por momentos grandiosa y casi siempre conmovedora .
1964	the movie makes absolutely no sense . its underlying mythology is a hodgepodge of inconsistencies that pose the question : since when did dumb entertainment have to be this dumb ?
1965	it should be mentioned that the set design and interiors of the haunted vessel are more than effectively creepy and moodily lit . so i just did .
1966	there has always been something likable about the marquis de sade .
1967	the real charm of this trifle is the deadpan comic face of its star , jean reno , who resembles sly stallone in a hot sake half-sleep .
1968	dignified ceo's meet at a rustic retreat and pee against a tree . can you bear the laughter ?
1969	harrison's flowers puts its heart in the right place , but its brains are in no particular place at all .
1970	funny in a sick , twisted sort of way .
1971	the movie is silly beyond comprehension , and even if it weren't silly , it would still be beyond comprehension .
1972	the best animated feature to hit theaters since beauty and the beast 11 years ago .
1973	the story is bogus and its characters tissue-thin .
1974	i would be shocked if there was actually one correct interpretation , but that shouldn't make the movie or the discussion any less enjoyable .
1975	there are laughs aplenty , and , as a bonus , viewers don't have to worry about being subjected to farts , urine , feces , semen , or any of the other foul substances that have overrun modern-day comedies .
1976	a movie far more cynical and lazy than anything a fictitious charlie kaufman might object to .
1977	in spite of featuring a script credited to no fewer than five writers , apparently nobody here bothered to check it twice .
1978	don't judge this one too soon - it's a dark , gritty story but it takes off in totally unexpected directions and keeps on going .
1979	'tobey maguire is a poster boy for the geek generation . '
1980	without non-stop techno or the existential overtones of a kieslowski morality tale , maelström is just another winter sleepers .
1981	the pianist [is] a supremely hopeful cautionary tale of war's madness remembered that we , today , can prevent its tragic waste of life . here is a divine monument to a single man's struggle to regain his life , his dignity and his music .
1982	max pokes , provokes , takes expressionistic license and hits a nerve . . . as far as art is concerned , it's mission accomplished .
1983	( it ) highlights not so much the crime lord's messianic bent , but spacey's .
1984	it's not difficult to spot the culprit early-on in this predictable thriller .
1985	exquisitely acted and masterfully if preciously interwoven… [the film] addresses in a fascinating , intelligent manner the intermingling of race , politics and local commerce .
1986	'film aficionados cannot help but love cinema paradiso , whether the original version or new director's cut . '
1987	this is cool , slick stuff , ready to quench the thirst of an audience that misses the summer blockbusters .
1988	sewer rats could watch this movie and be so skeeved out that they'd need a shower .
1989	lurid and less than lucid work .
1990	for once , a movie does not proclaim the truth about two love-struck somebodies , but permits them time and space to convince us of that all on their own .
1991	the case is a convincing one , and should give anyone with a conscience reason to pause .
1992	despite the film's bizarre developments , hoffman keeps us riveted with every painful nuance , unexpected flashes of dark comedy and the character's gripping humanity .
1993	the whole thing feels like a ruse , a tactic to cover up the fact that the picture is constructed around a core of flimsy -- or , worse yet , nonexistent -- ideas .
1994	it's all about anakin . . . and the lustrous polished visuals rich in color and creativity and , of course , special effect .
1995	the four feathers has rewards , from the exoticism of its seas of sand to the fierce grandeur of its sweeping battle scenes .
1996	it's another stale , kill-by-numbers flick , complete with blade-thin characters and terrible , pun-laden dialogue .
1997	as improbable as this premise may seem , abbass's understated , shining performance offers us the sense that on some elemental level , lilia deeply wants to break free of her old life .
1998	woody allen's latest is an ambling , broad comedy about all there is to love -- and hate -- about the movie biz .
1999	the performances of the children , untrained in acting , have an honesty and dignity that breaks your heart .
2000	not at all clear what it's trying to say and even if it were – i doubt it would be all that interesting .
2001	despite its title , amy's orgasm is not a porno , though it is as tedious as one .
2002	this is a very ambitious project for a fairly inexperienced filmmaker , but good actors , good poetry and good music help sustain it .
2003	one of the smarter offerings the horror genre has produced in recent memory , even if it's far tamer than advertised .
2004	the enormous comic potential of an oafish idiot impersonating an aristocrat remains sadly unrealized .
2005	. . . a light , yet engrossing piece . lux , now in her eighties , does a great combination act as narrator , jewish grandmother and subject – taking us through a film that is part biography , part entertainment and part history .
2006	the dramatic crisis doesn't always succeed in its quest to be taken seriously , but huppert's volatile performance makes for a riveting movie experience .
2007	the first mistake , i suspect , is casting shatner as a legendary professor and kunis as a brilliant college student--where's pauly shore as the rocket scientist ?
2008	the film is about the relationships rather than about the outcome . and it sees those relationships , including that between the son and his wife , and the wife and the father , and between the two brothers , with incredible subtlety and acumen .
2009	works hard to establish rounded characters , but then has nothing fresh or particularly interesting to say about them .
2010	it may play well as a double feature with mainstream foreign mush like my big fat greek wedding
2011	a suffocating rape-payback horror show that hinges on the subgenre's most enabling victim . . . and an ebullient affection for industrial-model meat freezers .
2012	a surprisingly charming and even witty match for the best of hollywood's comic-book adaptations .
2013	it's often faintly amusing , but the problems of the characters never become important to us , and the story never takes hold .
2014	this is a very fine movie -- go see it .
2015	eccentric enough to stave off doldrums , caruso's self-conscious debut is also eminently forgettable .
2016	a highly intriguing thriller , coupled with some ingenious plot devices and some lavishly built settings . . it's a worthwhile tutorial in quantum physics and slash-dash
2017	manages to be wholesome and subversive at the same time .
2018	much like its easily dismissive take on the upscale lifestyle , there isn't much there here .
2019	irwin is so earnest that it's hard to resist his pleas to spare wildlife and respect their environs . there are far worse messages to teach a young audience , which will probably be perfectly happy with the sloppy slapstick comedy .
2020	a love for films shines through each frame and the era is recreated with obvious affection , scored to perfection with some tasty boogaloo beats .
2021	although sensitive to a fault , it's often overwritten , with a surfeit of weighty revelations , flowery dialogue , and nostalgia for the past and roads not taken .
2022	marvelously entertaining and deliriously joyous documentary .
2023	in its own way , joshua is as blasphemous and nonsensical as a luis buñuel film without the latter's attendant intelligence , poetry , passion , and genius .
2024	sinks into the usual cafeteria goulash of fart jokes , masturbation jokes , and racist japanese jokes .
2025	it appears that something has been lost in the translation to the screen .
2026	if you're in the mood for a bollywood film , here's one for you .
2027	throughout all the tumult , a question comes to mind : so why is this so boring ?
2028	a minor film with major pleasures from portuguese master manoel de oliviera . . .
2029	you'd have to be a most hard-hearted person not to be moved by this drama .
2030	challenging , intermittently engrossing and unflaggingly creative . but it's too long and too convoluted and it ends in a muddle .
2031	a compelling portrait of moral emptiness
2032	bad beyond belief and ridiculous beyond description .
2033	writer-director juan carlos fresnadillo makes a feature debut that is fully formed and remarkably assured .
2034	a simple , sometimes maddeningly slow film that has just enough charm and good acting to make it interesting , but is ultimately pulled under by the pacing and lack of creativity within .
2035	this is a third-person story now , told by hollywood , and much more ordinary for it .
2036	a puzzling experience .
2037	exudes the fizz of a busby berkeley musical and the visceral excitement of a sports extravaganza .
2038	a feel-good movie that doesn't give you enough to feel good about .
2039	lawrence should stick to his day job . he's a better actor than a standup comedian .
2040	. . . a thoughtful what-if for the heart as well as the mind .
2041	it's a feel-good movie about which you can actually feel good .
2042	a well-rounded tribute to a man whose achievements -- and complexities -- reached far beyond the end zone .
2043	eric byler's nuanced pic avoids easy sentiments and explanations . . .
2044	its appeal will probably limited to lds church members and undemanding armchair tourists .
2045	'charly' will divide its audience in two separate groups , those reaching for more tissues and those begging for mercy . . .
2046	what's not to like about a movie with a 'children's' song that includes the line 'my stepdad's not mean , he's just adjusting' ?
2047	asia authors herself as anna battista , an italian superstar and aspiring directress who just happens to be her own worst enemy .
2048	ultimately , the film never recovers from the clumsy cliché of the ugly american abroad , and the too-frosty exterior ms . paltrow employs to authenticate her british persona is another liability .
2049	a moving and solidly entertaining comedy/drama that should bolster director and co-writer juan josé campanella's reputation in the united states .
2050	a ragbag of promising ideas and failed narrative , of good acting and plain old bad filmmaking .
2051	some people want the ol' ball-and-chain and then there are those who just want the ball and chain .
2052	unlike most anime , whose most ardent fans outside japan seem to be introverted young men with fantasy fetishes , metropolis never seems hopelessly juvenile .
2053	both shrill and soporific , and because everything is repeated five or six times , it can seem tiresomely simpleminded .
2054	chilling , well-acted , and finely directed : david jacobson's dahmer .
2055	like kissing jessica stein , amy's orgasm has a key strength in its willingness to explore its principal characters with honesty , insight and humor .
2056	bad . very bad . stultifyingly , dumbfoundingly , mind-numbingly bad .
2057	[sen's] soap opera-ish approach undermines his good intentions .
2058	the photographer's show-don't-tell stance is admirable , but it can make him a problematic documentary subject .
2059	not exactly the bees knees
2060	what ensues are much blood-splattering , mass drug-induced bowel evacuations , and none-too-funny commentary on the cultural distinctions between americans and brits .
2061	if reno is to the left of liberal on the political spectrum , her tough , funny , rather chaotic show isn't subversive so much as it is nit-picky about the hypocrisies of our time .
2062	think of it as gidget , only with muscles and a lot more smarts , but just as endearing and easy to watch .
2063	a shimmeringly lovely coming-of-age portrait , shot in artful , watery tones of blue , green and brown .
2064	care deftly captures the wonder and menace of growing up , but he never really embraces the joy of fuhrman's destructive escapism or the grace-in-rebellion found by his characters .
2065	funny but perilously slight .
2066	the central character isn't complex enough to hold our interest .
2067	theology aside , why put someone who ultimately doesn't learn at the center of a kids' story ?
2068	a yawn-provoking little farm melodrama .
2069	a well-executed spy-thriller .
2070	[a] real pleasure in its laid-back way .
2071	all-in-all , the film is an enjoyable and frankly told tale of a people who live among us , but not necessarily with us .
2072	it's a scattershot affair , but when it hits its mark it's brilliant .
2073	leigh's daring here is that without once denying the hardscrabble lives of people on the economic fringes of margaret thatcher's ruinous legacy , he insists on the importance of those moments when people can connect and express their love for each other .
2074	a thoughtful movie , a movie that is concerned with souls and risk and schemes and the consequences of one's actions .
2075	watching haneke's film is , aptly enough , a challenge and a punishment . but watching huppert , a great actress tearing into a landmark role , is riveting .
2076	twenty years later , e . t . is still a cinematic touchstone .
2077	hardly makes the kind of points egoyan wanted to make , nor does it exist as the kind of monument he wanted to build , to victims whose voices have never gained the ears of the world .
2078	the pace and the visuals are so hyped up that a curious sense of menace informs everything .
2079	moretti's compelling anatomy of grief and the difficult process of adapting to loss .
2080	the movie occasionally threatens to become didactic , but it's too grounded in the reality of its characters to go over the edge . a touch of humor or an unexpected plot twist always pulls it back .
2081	gangster no . 1 is solid , satisfying fare for adults .
2082	a cumbersome and cliche-ridden movie greased with every emotional device known to man .
2083	this isn't exactly profound cinema , but it's good-natured and sometimes quite funny .
2084	. . . just a big mess of a movie , full of images and events , but no tension or surprise .
2085	salma goes native and she's never been better in this colorful bio-pic of a mexican icon .
2086	a thoroughly awful movie--dumb , narratively chaotic , visually sloppy . . . a weird amalgam of 'the thing' and a geriatric 'scream . '
2087	jarecki and gibney do find enough material to bring kissinger's record into question and explain how the diplomat's tweaked version of statecraft may have cost thousands and possibly millions of lives .
2088	though the film is static , its writer-director's heart is in the right place , his plea for democracy and civic action laudable .
2089	much of the digitally altered footage appears jagged , as if filmed directly from a television monitor , while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome cliché .
2090	mana gives us compelling , damaged characters who we want to help -- or hurt .
2091	it may be an easy swipe to take , but this barbershop just doesn't make the cut .
2092	seems based on ugly ideas instead of ugly behavior , as happiness was . . . hence , storytelling is far more appealing .
2093	less funny than it should be and less funny than it thinks it is .
2094	vera's three actors -- mollà , gil and bardem -- excel in insightful , empathetic performances .
2095	writer/director john mckay ignites some charming chemistry between kate and jed but , when he veers into sodden melodrama , punctuated by violins , it's disastrous and kate's jealous female friends become downright despicable .
2096	a pleasant , if forgettable , romp of a film .
2097	manages to be both hugely entertaining and uplifting .
2098	it's a lovely , eerie film that casts an odd , rapt spell .
2099	its characters are thinner than cardboard -- or even comic-book paper .
2100	hollywood ending is the most disappointing woody allen movie ever . he has a great cast and a great idea . but the execution is a flop with the exception of about six gags that really work .
2101	beautifully reclaiming the story of carmen and recreating it an in an african idiom .
2102	jose campanella delivers a loosely autobiographical story brushed with sentimentality but brimming with gentle humor , bittersweet pathos , and lyric moments that linger like snapshots of memory .
2103	horrid little propaganda film with fascinating connections not only to the serbs themselves but also to a network of american right-wing extremists .
2104	the date movie that franz kafka would have made .
2105	sam mendes has become valedictorian at the school for soft landings and easy ways out .
2106	you'd think by now america would have had enough of plucky british eccentrics with hearts of gold . yet the act is still charming here .
2107	quite simply , a joy to watch and--especially--to listen to .
2108	tends to plod .
2109	the film is an enjoyable family film -- pretty much aimed at any youngster who loves horses .
2110	the script isn't very good ; not even someone as gifted as hoffman ( the actor ) can make it work .
2111	children and adults enamored of all things pokemon won't be disappointed .
2112	as aimless as an old pickup skidding completely out of control on a long patch of black ice , the movie makes two hours feel like four .
2113	a bonanza of wacky sight gags , outlandish color schemes , and corny visual puns that can be appreciated equally as an abstract frank tashlin comedy and as a playful recapitulation of the artist's career .
2114	a deliberative account of a lifestyle characterized by its surface-obsession – one that typifies the delirium of post , pre , and extant stardom .
2115	for dance completists only .
2116	harvard man is a semi-throwback , a reminiscence without nostalgia or sentimentality .
2117	like a less dizzily gorgeous companion to mr . wong's in the mood for love -- very much a hong kong movie despite its mainland setting .
2118	laugh-out-loud lines , adorably ditsy but heartfelt performances , and sparkling , bittersweet dialogue that cuts to the chase of the modern girl's dilemma .
2119	an exceedingly clever piece of cinema . another great ‘what you don't see' is much more terrifying than what you do see thriller , coupled with some arresting effects , incandescent tones and stupendous performances
2120	the modern master of the chase sequence returns with a chase to end all chases
2121	the action sequences are fun and reminiscent of combat scenes from the star wars series .
2122	there is something that is so meditative and lyrical about babak payami's boldly quirky iranian drama secret ballot . . . a charming and evoking little ditty that manages to show the gentle and humane side of middle eastern world politics
2123	the problem with concept films is that if the concept is a poor one , there's no saving the movie . sorry , charlie
2124	soulless and -- even more damning -- virtually joyless , xxx achieves near virtuosity in its crapulence .
2125	some may choose to interpret the film's end as hopeful or optimistic but i think payne is after something darker .
2126	buries an interesting storyline about morality and the choices we make underneath such a mountain of clichés and borrowed images that it might more accurately be titled mr . chips off the old block .
2127	very well made , but doesn't generate a lot of tension .
2128	there are moments of hilarity to be had .
2129	'compleja e intelectualmente retadora , el ladrón de orquídeas es uno de esos filmes que vale la pena ver precisamente por su originalidad . '
2130	they threw loads of money at an idea that should've been so much more even if it was only made for teenage boys and wrestling fans .
2131	if a few good men told us that we " can't handle the truth " than high crimes poetically states at one point in this movie that we " don't care about the truth . "
2132	'interesante y disfrutable trabajo gracias a que prescinde del clásico elemento estadounidense patriotero y manipulador . '
2133	we may get the full visceral impact of a ruthless army on the warpath but no sense of the devilish complexity of the balkans conflict .
2134	un thriller manqué qui tombe sur les nerfs presque dès la première image .
2135	" the tuxedo " should have been the vehicle for chan that " the mask " was for jim carrey . alas , it's the man that makes the clothes .
2136	from both a great and a terrible story , mr . nelson has made a film that is an undeniably worthy and devastating experience .
2137	traffics in the kind of prechewed racial clichés that have already been through the corporate stand-up-comedy mill .
2138	it's unnerving to see recoing's bizzarre reaction to his unemployment . good film , but very glum .
2139	arguably the best script that besson has written in years .
2140	if you're down for a silly hack-and-slash flick , you can do no wrong with jason x .
2141	romantic , riveting and handsomely animated .
2142	it briefly flirts with player masochism , but the point of real interest -– audience sadism -- is evaded completely .
2143	the fast runner' transports the viewer into an unusual space
2144	building slowly and subtly , the film , sporting a breezy spontaneity and realistically drawn characterizations , develops into a significant character study that is both moving and wise .
2145	the most repugnant adaptation of a classic text since roland joffé and demi moore's the scarlet letter .
2146	sustains its dreamlike glide through a succession of cheesy coincidences and voluptuous cheap effects , not the least of which is rebecca romijn-stamos .
2147	the actors pull out all the stops in nearly every scene , but to diminishing effect . the characters never change .
2148	a modest masterpiece .
2149	a three-hour cinema master class .
2150	there's just something about watching a squad of psychopathic underdogs whale the tar out of unsuspecting lawmen that reaches across time and distance .
2151	[shyamalan] turns the goose-pimple genre on its empty head and fills it with spirit , purpose and emotionally bruised characters who add up to more than body count .
2152	i suspect this is the kind of production that would have been funnier if the director had released the outtakes theatrically and used the film as a bonus feature on the dvd .
2153	it's obvious [je-gyu is] trying for poetry ; what he gets instead has all the lyricism of a limerick scrawled in a public restroom .
2154	[the film] tackles the topic of relationships in such a straightforward , emotionally honest manner that by the end , it's impossible to ascertain whether the film is , at its core , deeply pessimistic or quietly hopeful .
2155	a mostly intelligent , engrossing and psychologically resonant suspenser .
2156	the obligatory break-ups and hook-ups don't seem to have much emotional impact on the characters .
2157	horns and halos benefits from serendipity but also reminds us of our own responsibility to question what is told as the truth .
2158	sometimes makes less sense than the bruckheimeresque american action flicks it emulates .
2159	this rich , bittersweet israeli documentary , about the life of song-and-dance-man pasach'ke burstein and his family , transcends ethnic lines .
2160	may be far from the best of the series , but it's assured , wonderfully respectful of its past and thrilling enough to make it abundantly clear that this movie phenomenon has once again reinvented itself for a new generation .
2161	the trials of henry kissinger is a remarkable piece of filmmaking … because you get it .
2162	unambitious writing emerges in the movie , using a plot that could have come from an animated-movie screenwriting textbook .
2163	. . . stumbles over every cheap trick in the book trying to make the outrage come even easier .
2164	on its own cinematic terms , it successfully showcases the passions of both the director and novelist byatt .
2165	strip it of all its excess debris , and you'd have a 90-minute , four-star movie . as it is , it's too long and unfocused .
2166	it tells more than it shows .
2167	a sexy , peculiar and always entertaining costume drama set in renaissance spain , and the fact that it's based on true events somehow makes it all the more compelling .
2168	behind the snow games and lovable siberian huskies ( plus one sheep dog ) , the picture hosts a parka-wrapped dose of heart .
2169	it ain't art , by a long shot , but unlike last year's lame musketeer , this dumas adaptation entertains .
2170	the result is a gaudy bag of stale candy , something from a halloween that died .
2171	knows how to make our imagination wonder .
2172	there is little question that this is a serious work by an important director who has something new to say about how , in the flip-flop of courtship , we often reel in when we should be playing out .
2173	lead actress gaï , she of the impossibly long limbs and sweetly conspiratorial smile , is a towering siren .
2174	jacquot's tosca is a treat .
2175	funny and also heartwarming without stooping to gooeyness .
2176	schepisi , aided by a cast that seems to include every top-notch british actor who did not appear in gosford park ( as well as one , ms . mirren , who did ) , has succeeded beyond all expectation .
2177	to the vast majority of more casual filmgoers , it will probably be a talky bore .
2178	an empty , purposeless exercise .
2179	it would be great to see this turd squashed under a truck , preferably a semi .
2180	in old-fashioned screenwriting parlance , ms . shreve's novel proved too difficult a text to 'lick , ' despite the efforts of a first-rate cast .
2181	brings together some of the biggest names in japanese anime , with impressive results .
2182	every now and again , a movie comes along to remind us of how very bad a motion picture can truly be . frank mcklusky c . i . is that movie !
2183	very stupid and annoying .
2184	it inspires a continuing and deeply satisfying awareness of the best movies as monumental 'picture shows . '
2185	just because a walk to remember is shrewd enough to activate girlish tear ducts doesn't mean it's good enough for our girls .
2186	as if trying to grab a lump of play-doh , the harder that liman tries to squeeze his story , the more details slip out between his fingers .
2187	although the sequel has all the outward elements of the original , the first film's lovely flakiness is gone , replaced by the forced funniness found in the dullest kiddie flicks .
2188	the appeal of the vulgar , sexist , racist humour went over my head or -- considering just how low brow it is -- perhaps it snuck under my feet .
2189	an uninspired preachy and clichéd war film .
2190	though perry and hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by jay scherick and david ronn , neither the actors nor director reginald hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining .
2191	egoyan's movie is too complicated to sustain involvement , and , if you'll excuse a little critical heresy , too intellectually ambitious .
2192	the sort of movie that gives tastelessness a bad rap .
2193	a minor picture with a major identity crisis -- it's sort of true and it's sort of bogus and it's ho-hum all the way through .
2194	assured , glossy and shot through with brittle desperation .
2195	this comic gem is as delightful as it is derivative .
2196	if the real-life story is genuinely inspirational , the movie stirs us as well .
2197	it wasn't the subject matter that ultimately defeated the film…it was the unfulfilling , incongruous , " wait a second , did i miss something ? " ending .
2198	from blushing to gushing---imamura squirts the screen in ‘warm water under a red bridge'
2199	as expected , sayles' smart wordplay and clever plot contrivances are as sharp as ever , though they may be overshadowed by some strong performances .
2200	plot , characters , drama , emotions , ideas -- all are irrelevant to the experience of seeing the scorpion king .
2201	little more than a well-mounted history lesson .
2202	this isn't a narrative film -- i don't know if it's possible to make a narrative film about september 11th , though i'm sure some will try -- but it's as close as anyone has dared to come .
2203	you'll have more fun setting fire to yourself in the parking lot . you'll be more entertained getting hit by a bus .
2204	a piquant meditation on the things that prevent people from reaching happiness .
2205	caruso sometimes descends into sub-tarantino cuteness . . . but for the most part he makes sure the salton sea works the way a good noir should , keeping it tight and nasty .
2206	i can take infantile humor . . . but this is the sort of infantile that makes you wonder about changing the director and writer's diapers .
2207	yo , it's the days of our lives meets electric boogaloo .
2208	director uwe boll and writer robert dean klein fail to generate any interest in an unsympathetic hero caught up in an intricate plot that while cleverly worked out , cannot overcome blah characters .
2209	the performances of the four main actresses bring their characters to life . a little melodramatic , but with enough hope to keep you engaged .
2210	'pocas ideas interesantes , un final pseudo místico que no corresponde al tono general del filme y que deja una sensación de inconformidad que hace pensar más de una vez si vale la pena ir a la taquilla y reclamar el precio del boleto . '
2211	features fincher's characteristically startling visual style and an almost palpable sense of intensity .
2212	enticing and often funny documentary .
2213	if you like blood , guts and crazy beasts stalking men with guns though . . . you will likely enjoy this monster .
2214	sweet home alabama isn't going to win any academy awards , but this date-night diversion will definitely win some hearts .
2215	the story gives ample opportunity for large-scale action and suspense , which director shekhar kapur supplies with tremendous skill .
2216	the problem with this film is that it's forced to make its characters idiots in order to advance the plot . had anyone here done anything remotely intelligent , we all could have stopped watching long ago .
2217	a harrowing account of a psychological breakdown .
2218	a charming but slight comedy .
2219	has a certain ghoulish fascination , and generates a fair amount of b-movie excitement .
2220	writer/director burr steers emphasizes the q in quirky , with mixed results .
2221	short and sweet , but also more than anything else slight… tadpole pulls back from the consequences of its own actions and revelations .
2222	the maudlin way its story unfolds suggests a director fighting against the urge to sensationalize his material .
2223	far more successful , if considerably less ambitious , than last year's kubrick-meets-spielberg exercise .
2224	the entire cast is extraordinarily good .
2225	a hypnotic portrait of this sad , compulsive life .
2226	it's not life-affirming — its vulgar and mean , but i liked it .
2227	ken russell would love this . in one scene , we get a stab at soccer hooliganism , a double-barreled rip-off of quentin tarantino's climactic shootout — and meat loaf explodes .
2228	the film's lack of personality permeates all its aspects — from the tv movie-esque , affected child acting to the dullest irish pub scenes ever filmed .
2229	ethan hawke has always fancied himself the bastard child of the beatnik generation and it's all over his chelsea walls .
2230	the art direction and costumes are gorgeous and finely detailed , and kurys' direction is clever and insightful .
2231	a non-mystery mystery .
2232	montias . . . pumps a lot of energy into his nicely nuanced narrative and surrounds himself with a cast of quirky -- but not stereotyped -- street characters .
2233	its strengths and weaknesses play off each other virtually to a stand-off , with the unfortunate trump card being the dreary mid-section of the film .
2234	what little grace [rifkin's] tale of precarious skid-row dignity achieves is pushed into the margins by predictable plotting and tiresome histrionics .
2235	contrived as this may sound , mr . rose's updating works surprisingly well .
2236	even on those rare occasions when the narrator stops yammering , miller's hand often feels unsure .
2237	a knowing sense of humor and a lot of warmth ignite son of the bride .
2238	there's just no currency in deriding james bond for being a clichéd , doddering , misogynistic boy's club .
2239	as weber and weissman demonstrate with such insight and celebratory verve , the cockettes weren't as much about gender , sexual preference or political agitprop as they were simply a triumph of the indomitable human will to rebel , connect and create .
2240	blade ii merges bits and pieces from fighting games , wire fu , horror movies , mystery , james bond , wrestling , sci-fi and anime into one big bloody stew .
2241	. . . always remains movingly genuine .
2242	allen se atreve a atacar , a atacarse y nos ofrece gags que van de la sonrisa a la risa de larga duración
2243	it's almost impossible not to be moved by the movie's depiction of sacrifice and its stirring epilogue in post-soviet russia .
2244	often demented in a good way , but it is an uneven film for the most part .
2245	both overstuffed and undernourished . . . the film can't be called a solid success , although there's plenty of evidence here to indicate clooney might have better luck next time .
2246	if you want to see a train wreck that you can't look away from , then look no further , because here it is .
2247	béart and berling are both superb , while huppert . . . is magnificent .
2248	sodden and glum , even in those moments where it's supposed to feel funny and light .
2249	too much of the humor falls flat .
2250	it almost feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us .
2251	[garbus] discards the potential for pathological study , exhuming instead , the skewed melodrama of the circumstantial situation .
2252	" extreme ops " exceeds expectations . good fun , good action , good acting , good dialogue , good pace , good cinematography .
2253	while benigni ( who stars and co-wrote ) seems to be having a wonderful time , he might be alone in that .
2254	too silly to be frightening , too stolid to be funny , it projects the same lazy affability as its nominal star , david arquette .
2255	recalls quiet freak-outs like l'avventura and repulsion .
2256	maybe you'll be lucky , and there'll be a power outage during your screening so you can get your money back .
2257	intelligent and moving .
2258	audrey tatou has a knack for picking roles that magnify her outrageous charm , and in this literate french comedy , she's as morning-glory exuberant as she was in amélie .
2259	though a bit of a patchwork in script and production , a glossy , rich green , environment almost makes the picture work .
2260	pray has really done his subject justice .
2261	it plays like a big-budget , after-school special with a generous cast , who at times lift the material from its well-meaning clunkiness .
2262	each scene drags , underscoring the obvious , and sentiment is slathered on top .
2263	what makes the movie work — to an admittedly limited extent — is the commitment of two genuinely engaging performers . weaver and lapaglia are both excellent , in the kind of low-key way that allows us to forget that they are actually movie folk .
2264	it irritates and saddens me that martin lawrence's latest vehicle can explode obnoxiously into 2 , 500 screens while something of bubba ho-tep's clearly evident quality may end up languishing on a shelf somewhere .
2265	a model of what films like this should be like .
2266	just because it really happened to you , honey , doesn't mean that it's interesting to anyone else .
2267	skillful as he is , mr . shyamalan is undone by his pretensions .
2268	the story really has no place to go since simone is not real—she can't provide any conflict .
2269	horrendously amateurish filmmaking that is plainly dull and visually ugly when it isn't incomprehensible .
2270	newcomer helmer kevin donovan is hamstrung by a badly handled screenplay of what is really an amusing concept – a high-tech tux that transforms its wearer into a superman .
2271	heartwarming here relies less on forced air than on petter næss' delicate , clever direction . . . and a wonderful , imaginative script by axel hellstenius .
2272	an ambitious , serious film that manages to do virtually everything wrong ; sitting through it is something akin to an act of cinematic penance .
2273	dong never pushes for insights beyond the superficial tensions of the dynamic he's dissecting , and the film settles too easily along the contours of expectation .
2274	the vivid lead performances sustain interest and empathy , but the journey is far more interesting than the final destination .
2275	a miraculous movie , i'm going home is so slight , yet overflows with wisdom and emotion .
2276	' . . . both hokey and super-cool , and definitely not in a hurry , so sit back , relax and have a few laughs while the little ones get a fuzzy treat . '
2277	compellingly watchable .
2278	i saw knockaround guys yesterday , and already the details have faded like photographs from the spanish-american war . . . it's so unmemorable that it turned my ballpoint notes to invisible ink .
2279	with amazing finesse , the film shadows heidi's trip back to vietnam and the city where her mother , mai thi kim , still lives .
2280	kosminsky . . . puts enough salt into the wounds of the tortured and self-conscious material to make it sting .
2281	. . . while each moment of this broken character study is rich in emotional texture , the journey doesn't really go anywhere .
2282	it recycles every cliché about gays in what is essentially an extended soap opera .
2283	the film is one of the year's best .
2284	you see robin williams and psycho killer , and you think , hmmmmm . you see the movie and you think , zzzzzzzzz .
2285	good-naturedly cornball sequel .
2286	now here's a sadistic bike flick that would have made vittorio de sica proud .
2287	tends to pile too many " serious issues " on its plate at times , yet remains fairly light , always entertaining , and smartly written .
2288	the delicious trimmings…arrive early and stay late , filling nearly every minute…with a lighthearted glow , some impudent snickers , and a glorious dose of humankind's liberating ability to triumph over a scrooge or two .
2289	a formula family tearjerker told with a heavy irish brogue . . . accentuating , rather than muting , the plot's saccharine thrust .
2290	none of birthday girl's calculated events take us by surprise . . .
2291	an ambitious , guilt-suffused melodrama crippled by poor casting .
2292	the story the movie tells is of brian de palma's addiction to the junk-calorie suspense tropes that have all but ruined his career .
2293	the sweetest thing , a romantic comedy with outrageous tendencies , may be a mess in a lot of ways . but it does have one saving grace . a lot of its gags and observations reflect a woman's point-of-view .
2294	for the most part , director anne-sophie birot's first feature is a sensitive , extraordinarily well-acted drama .
2295	leaves viewers out in the cold and undermines some phenomenal performances .
2296	like old myths and wonder tales spun afresh .
2297	to imagine the life of harry potter as a martial arts adventure told by a lobotomized woody allen is to have some idea of the fate that lies in store for moviegoers lured to the mediocrity that is kung pow : enter the fist .
2298	it's young guns meets goodfellas in this easily skippable hayseeds-vs . -greaseballs mob action-comedy .
2299	É uma pena que , mais tarde , o próprio filme abandone o tom de paródia e passe a utilizar os mesmos clichês que havia satirizado .
2300	full of surprises .
2301	due to stodgy , soap opera-ish dialogue , the rest of the cast comes across as stick figures reading lines from a teleprompter .
2302	a road trip that will get you thinking , 'are we there yet ? '
2303	too slow for a younger crowd , too shallow for an older one .
2304	clint eastwood's blood work is a lot like a well-made pb& j sandwich : familiar , fairly uneventful and boasting no real surprises – but still quite tasty and inviting all the same .
2305	sheridan . . . smoothes over sources of conflict that could have lent the film a bit more depth .
2306	merely ( and literally ) tosses around sex toys and offers half-hearted paeans to empowerment that are repeatedly undercut by the brutality of the jokes , most at women's expense .
2307	smith examines the intimate , unguarded moments of folks who live in unusual homes -- which pop up in nearly every corner of the country .
2308	as a feature-length film , it wears out its welcome as tryingly as the title character .
2309	skillfully weaves both the elements of the plot and a powerfully evocative mood combining heated sexuality with a haunting sense of malaise .
2310	labute can't avoid a fatal mistake in the modern era : he's changed the male academic from a lower-class brit to an american , a choice that upsets the novel's exquisite balance and shreds the fabric of the film .
2311	odd and weird .
2312	ultimately , sarah's dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic , and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case that one woman's broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness .
2313	digital-video documentary about stand-up comedians is a great glimpse into a very different world .
2314	a mean-spirited film made by someone who surely read the catcher in the rye but clearly suffers from dyslexia
